My job consists of me adding up numbers and keeping a database of items.  I've never been great at math, but can you give me any tips to dealing with numbers that add up to a total end count?

Edit:  Sorry for being vague,  after all the negative responses, I can see that I should have given you more information.  

Here we go again.....  I get paid to keep an inventory of film.  What has been exposed, what had been short ended(if we load up a 1000ft mag, and only shoot 300ft, then 700ft is a short end), and what hasn't been shot.  We do not keep anything under 200 feet.  So through out the day, I have to keep an updated film inventory and let the boss man know how much we have exposed and what is left on the truck.  Usually we start out with around 25,000 feet of film.  Throughout the day we might shoot anywhere from 5-20,000 feet of film.  I use a spread sheet to keep everything in order, but my spreadsheet doesn't work very well, and has bugs.  With that that, I plan on just doing everything by hand.  

Do you have any recommendations to work on my math skills, as it has been years since I have had to keep track of numbers manually like this.  Maybe some one you are good at excel and can help me fix my problems, maybe you have advice on studying, I don't know.

This is most of his message: Warning Graphic descriptions.

Thanks for thinking of me ... the worst happened on Kauai... A P-3 Orion radar craft crashed into the mountain ridge at Makaha, on the West side, with 14 people on board. The bodies were stretched out over the ridge (9) and then down in a valley next to it (5). The largest piece was a torso, with entails strewn all over, festooning the Haole Koa... a loud drift of flies buzzing everywhere and about 30 pigs chowing down on the cadaver parts when we arrived at dawn. My most vivid memory was that of a pig with a forearm in its mouth, grunting, standing it's' ground and refusing to back away from a pile of parts... we had to shoot it to start the others moving away.

That incident bothered me for some time afterward... but there were others... people with piles of brains in the road... small children beaten to death by their parents... all kinds of stuff.

Another incident that bothered me was one where I was in charge at the Waikoloa station. We went to an auto accident and I had classic tunnel vision. We were pulling the driver out of the car, severely injured, when one of the guys came up to me and asked... ""What do you want me to do with the body?"" ...THE BODY! What body? A three year old had been thrown from the car and was dead at the scene. That one really shook me up.

In another case, I was driving the ambulance in Waimea and we were going shopping. In front of us was a flat bed vegetable truck, mostly empty, with a old Filipino man sitting on the bed. The truck hit a bump in the road and the Filipino man went up in the air and landed on the road in front of us... striking the back of his head. We very nearly ran him over as we screeched to a skidding stop. When we got out and examined him his eyes were fixed and dilated... dead. I almost was part of that one.

How do you know you have an immaterial soul? No one has ever observed or measured one. Where is it inside the body? If science and empiricism cannot detect it, how can you be sure it exists? 

Without an immaterial soul, how can we possibly have free will? If our thoughts and actions are determined by our brains and our brains are comprised solely of neurons and electrochemical reactions, then our actions are governed entirely by the deterministic laws of physics at a fundamental level, i.e. no free will. Another less materialistic argument against free will is the following: you do what you do because of the way you are. But you can't be ultimately responsible for the way you are because the way you are is entirely the result of your genetic inheritance and previous experience. Therefore, you can't be ultimately responsible for what you do; no free will.

Now I know it's much easier to simply say we have a soul and free will because the Bible says so, but I'm afraid that's just not a good enough response. Science and logic are not in your favor.

2529,"I really enjoy Electronic Music but my tastes are a bit eccentric so I have no idea what 'genre' of electronic music I actually like.  Sometimes I think it's tech house, sometimes electro, sometimes ... whatever but I always find maybe one more two songs from a specific genre and the rest sound like junk to me.

Here's a bunch of songs that I really like:

[Jump Jump Dance Dance - Modern Eyes Bitfunk remix](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGeBsq3Vt2Q)

[LexiconDon - Student Body Bitfunk Remix](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXkd-Q3J_18)

[The Kickdrums - Love is a Drug to Me Kolt13 Rework](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qPAVsQjanXE)

[MemoryHouse - To The Lighthouse - MillionYoung edit](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xymk20gPTVs) - LOOOVEE this song.

I like most of Duck Sauce's stuff.

Mostly I guess I really enjoy moving basslines, not too repetitive and I hate annoying and long builds to the drop... just gets on my nerves.  For example my favorite drop is from [Little Boots - Remedy - Buffetlibre vs Sidechains @~1:00-1:20](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P52795fm4as)

I've seen some people here that can be pretty immature and nasty, but for the most part they get downvoted to oblivion.  I've been hanging around here for a while, and I comment/post a few times a week, but I RARELY see any condescending or disrespectful replies.  When I do, I don't even think about them long enough to roll my eyes, it's already ignored and out of my mind.

I think this is one of the LEAST misogynic places on the web.  Outside of sarcasm and jokes, I really don't think I've ever seen a legitimately misogynic comment here get upvoted.  People who get easily offended by jokes (misogynist or otherwise) shouldn't be on the internet in the first place.

The internet can be awful, and it can be awesome.  It can be awful in r/politics and r/askreddit because people often go there to vent.  However, if you're looking for a community sharing a particular interest, the subreddits here can be the best place on the entire web.  We have some of the friendliest most helpful mavens out there, and that shouldn't be overlooked just because of a few losers.

**TL;DR:**  Compared to other anonymous online communities, it's pretty nice here.  Just hang out in better subreddits, and learn how to ignore the garbage.

4948,"so a few weeks ago a co-worker of mine, markus,  informed me that he would be having his niece move in with him from a state very far removed(both geographically and culturally) from our own. he inquired as to weather or not i would be interested in showing her around town and just helping her get generally acquainted with some people our age, things we do for fun etc. i told him i'd be happy to and didn't think a whole lot more of it. so markus's niece, loretta, got to town like a week ago and he brought her into our job to introduce us. i was absolutely floored. she is extremely cute and has a very heartwarming personality. she also happens to be vegetarian. being vegan, compassion for animals is something i look for in a woman, and unfortunately its not the most common trait, but one that she seems to exemplify, as near as i can tell. she's into bikes. i'm into bikes. she listens to older hc/punk bands. i listen to older hc/punk bands. we're both fans of mary jane. see what i'm gettin at? it just seemed pretty coincidental. 
 
however, upon asking why exactly she just up and moved so far from friends and family all of a sudden,  explained that she has an ""ex""-boyfriend at home who she is still in contact with despite his infidelities being a primary reason for her relocation. i didn't really ask for details. 
anyways,   markus is quite a bit older than i and i respect him quite a bit as he has given me some really good advice on a number of subjects both personal and professional. naturally, i wouldn't want to be a total asshole and bombard her with attention of the romantic sort when the poor girl is trying to remove herself from what sounds like a sticky situation. i also feel like markus wasn't boyfriend shopping for her, just trying to find her a friend in a new place. but at the same time...she's got an AWESOME personality and i'm really, really attracted to her. what should i do reddit? bite my tongue and stay the straight and narrow, wondering what may have possibly maybe been? or, something else. help.

5505,"We're in our early twenties and have known each other for years.  We are in the same group of friends.  I'm a girl with no relationship experience, and he's a guy with a past filled with short relationships.

I think there's something brewing between us for various reasons, such as him resting his hand on my knee when we talk to each other.  At any rates, I obviously like him.

As a rule, I'm usually studying.  I usually have papers to write and problems to solve and the time I spend with my friends I consider precious and spare.  However, when this guy and I are talking to each other, neither of us can really figure out how to shut up and move on. For instance, I visited him the other day for a quick question (that still had to be dealt with in person).  We got off topic, eventually starting a teasing/physical fight.  It was already late into the night (as in early morning), and I was sort of making motions to leave, when he suggests watching a movie or playing online video games.  His computer was messing up, so we ended up just talking a bit longer before I left.  I guess you could call that leaving, but he kept talking to me even after I closed his door, and I was not making a rush to depart either.

These sort of things like to happen.  I then chastise myself and try to make up for lost time.  On the other hand, I'm always glad these stupid things happen.  I've had more than one person wake me up from a smiling reverie.  I'm sure that I have spent more time with him than the time I have spent with several other friends put together, including my roommate.

Issues:

1. He dated one of our closest mutual friends a couple of years ago.  I've spoken to her about it and she's completely over him and they've been friends ever since.  She's even given me her blessing.  A couple of months ago, he was rambling about things (he had some alcohol in his system) and mentioned that he regretted breaking up with her.

2. If we're studying together or something and a girl walks by, he lets me know what her favorable features are.  He sometimes has many superficial crushes, but recently he told a friend of ours (in my presence) that he had no ""real"" crushes at the moment.

3. He often tells me little ways to improve my appearance in order to attract more guys.

4. Most importantly, he talks about what he likes about girls, and his fantasies rarely describe me.  I'm too short and my eyes are not quite prominent enough.

http://blog.reddit.com/2009/08/reddits-fatastic-voyage-reddit.html

I think *that* idea is **amazing.** Let me throw in my two cents, or as we germans say ""Lass mich mal mein Senf dazu geben""

About four years ago when I was still playing World of warcraft we organised a guild meeting for our super amazing ""Suicide Kings"" guild.

*Anyway* We organised a guild meeting where we had about 20 guys and girls fly in from all over the world and they stayed at my apartment in Germany for a weekend. It was so much fun being around these people in real life. Being around such like-minded individuals. You could tell some of them were really socially awkward but as soon as they were around other people that were like them they flowered and were completely fine.

We did all kinds of stuff and I took them out to show them some cool things in my city.

This sort of thing is a lot of fun. And I don't mean hanging around in one ""convention centre"", I mean a good group of people watching maybe a cult movie and going to oktoberfest together. Or having a huge BBQ etc.

Maybe an international flash mob event?

Or taking a train to Finland and seeing wtf is going on over there.

Or meeting in Australia to see what it's like standing upside down.

I'm sure it was an awesome feeling being at the rally as well. Knowing you are surrounded by other Redditors.

I would really love to support an international get together of reddit users. 

Would other reddit user be interested in organising something like this?

The problem is, these people aren't willing to consider anything else. They know they believe marijuana is bad, but their stubbornness won't let them agree to anything else.

My chest went from a 36 to 40
Biceps- 14-15
Quads-21-23
Waist is like the same

In a nutshell, I did bodyweight stuff mostly, and started lifting recently (I always lifted legs though).  I play a lot of basketball.  I do sprints, and only do long cardio when i feel my endurance is lacking.

For lifting I usually do 10 8 6 4, for reps, with drop sets on the last 2 sets.

Diet- Lotta protein and vegetables, nuts, and fruit.  I try and limit grains but I'm arab so i still eat a lot of pita bread (whole grain though).  I also love cereal, but i only eat that after workouts, and not daily.

9217,"I collected old video game cartridges, consoles, PC games and other paraphernalia for a number of years. My interest in it eventually waned, and earlier this year I eventually decided to sell off what I had. I knew some friends had used ebay to sell this sort of stuff so I decided to give it a go. I had quite a bit of this stuff so I listed it in small batches, 50-60 or so auctions a week, for about four months until it was all (mostly) sold.

I had what I thought was a fairly straightforward policy in every auction. I made a single photograph of every item (ebay charges you for extra photos) and made an attempt to list any other defects I didn't think were obvious from the photograph. I stated that the buyer would receive what was in the photograph and nothing more. I said that the item was sold AS-IS (meaning that a buyer agrees they can't return it if they don't like it, NO refunds, and the ""no returns"" option was chosen for every auction). I also tried my best to keep shipping costs down as much as I could by offering the cheaper shipping options (first class or media mail) when I could, and combining shipping when people bought more than one thing from a batch. 

I would say that out of 95% of all transactions, things went really smooth. The buyers were satisfied and I got paid. 2% of the time, people didn't pay, but you have to wait before you can file a case to get your ""end item fees"" back. 1% of the time people asked for refunds for what I thought were legitimate reasons (usually I made a mistake on the auction page) and I gave them their money back. The other 2% of the time I dealt with a lot of childish, petulant morons, and I took it in the ass from ebay, every time. 

Ebay forces you to list a shipping cost BEFORE the auction goes live, and in order to combine shipping (to keep costs LOW for buyers of multiple things) I couldn't box anything up until the current batch was done. This made it impossible to know what the real shipping cost would be, so I had to use my scale and make a guess at what the cost of shipping single items would be. I got better at at my estimates towards the end but sometimes the true shipping cost would be higher. Some buyers refused to pay the difference, and ebay sided with them **every time** and I was forced to pay the difference. The irony of this is that I eventually started listing slightly INFLATED estimates so that this would never happen, and then send buyers invoices that reflected a LOWER shipping cost. The result? Most buyers ended up paying the inflated shipping costs before I even had a chance to send them their invoices. 

Sometimes buyers were just unhappy with what they bought. Buyers remorse most likely. Usually they claimed the item was significantly different than what was pictured (it wasn't) or that it had damage not shown (it didn't). Sometimes USPS smashed their box (not my problem or my fault). I apologized for their unhappiness but reminded them of the AS-IS statement in every auction. Usually they would demand a refund (which I would refuse), and they would file a case with ebay. It doesn't matter what my auction says, one particular rude customer says, **ebay's policy overrides yours and I'll get my money back**. Ebay took my money from me and gave it to them **every time**. It didn't seen to matter what I wrote down as an explanation. My blood pressure started to rise.

Then there were the buyers that you simply couldn't satisfy. They demanded things that no reasonable person would (or could) accommodate. For most of these I successfully ""canceled"" the transaction but I had to relist. I had one buyer who AFTER the auction ended demanded that I box the item in such a way that no possible damage would come to it (simply not possible in reality) and that I was to **guarantee** the item would arrive in the condition pictured. I calmly told them I would be glad to double (or triple) box the item and ship insured but they would have to pay extra for it. They refused. I canceled the transaction and they gave me negative feedback (I drank myself to sleep that night).

The straw that broke the camels back was with the guy that bought a poster (ended up selling for about $50). I put it in a tube and sent it to him media mail (to keep costs low, otherwise people bitch about high shipping costs). He didn't buy insurance. A month goes by and he sends a message saying it's not there. I tell him it's out of my hands and to talk to the post office. Another week and he sends another message asking what his options are. I again tell him it's out of my hands, talk to the post office. He open a case, I explain that it was sent and he didn't buy insurance, ebay closes the case five minutes later (in his favor), takes the money from me and gives it to him. I looked at my computer screen stunned for a while in amazement before the anger (and the pain in my anus) set in. I ended up writing the guy telling him I thought it was bullshit and he agreed and we ended up splitting the refund 50/50.

tl;dr People that buy from you on ebay can get their money back for any reason at all, and you have no recourse

It's one big joke, and there isn't a solid party with which I feel most of us can resonate enough with to be worth a shit. So I started thinking...

Why don't we start our own? Closest thing to what I am thinking is http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_American_Independent_Party but even so it doesn't seem to have done much. I am talking about grass roots, tech savvy, empirical data using, non-denomination based, common-sense-ism of a party.

Huge transparency, community based, web coordinated collaboration and deliberation on issues and topics leading to appointed members and candidates. Not fettered by rich assholes that are out of touch and in it for their own interests. 

I'm just an average dude tired of the shit. Wikileaks has it right for showing the country the reality they've sold themselves to and I want to live in a world where we can own up to the shit we actually do instead of hiding behind and obfuscating our responsibilities as citizens and subsequently as a nation. Telling the truth and doing the right thing is never easy. I just hope my parents weren't the only ones raising their kids to believe that.

9806,"Hey Reddit friends, this is a throwaway account. I hate to do this, but I'm asking for help. But it's not for free. 

I am 29, live in Los Angeles. I've been unemployed for over a year, getting work here and there but not nearly enough. My rent is due today and I have zero money. I don't know where else to turn. I have roommates and don't want to burden them or drag them down with my non-payment.

I own a small business: I self-published a deck of playing card for the game of Mafia (the party game). I make a little money off this each month, usually very little. Instead of just asking for a handout, would you consider buying a deck of Mafia cards from me? If I can get roughly 50 orders, I can pay my rent. I will also send you two decks for the price of one. It's a really fun and well-made game. Please understand this is not a ploy to market my game, this is a sincere call for help. 

I'd be super appreciative if you'd consider doing this for me. Please type in ""Reddit"" in the ""Add coment to seller"" section while purchasing and I'll ship an extra deck to you. 

They need to be purchased through http://www.mafiacards.com

Thanks for listening.

There are various data series (temperature, humidity, etc), each of which contains a series of data points, and indexes into an array of datetimes, on various time scales (Some series are hourly, others 3-hourly, some daily). Is there any sort of library for dealing with data like this, and accessing it in a user-friendly way.

Ideal usage would be something like:

db = TimeData()
db.set_val('2010-12-01 12:00','temp',34)
db.set_val('2010-12-01 15:00','temp',37)

db.set_val('2010-12-01 13:00','wind',6)
db.query('2010-12-01 13:00') # {'wind':6, 'temp':34}

Basically the query would return the most recent value of each series. 

I looked at scikits.timeseries, but it isn't very amenable to this use case, due to the amount of pre-computation involved (it expects all the data in one shot, no random-access setting).

10690,"So I've had varying success with making gravy over the past few years.  I like to try to make gravy after sauteing chicken, pan frying beef, or cooking a steak by saute/oven roast.  

What I'd like to know is -- how much of what ingredients do people like to use?  I used to do something like this:  deglaze with broth or wine, let reduce, add a slurry of stock mixed with a thickener and cook until thickened.  There were a number of problems.  I usually have the pan very hot when adding the deglazing agent, and I have found it almost immediately evaporates/thickens/reduces.  Perhaps I should lower the heat here, or add more deglazing agent?  The problem I have found with that is, depending on what is used to deglaze, that taste can overpower the gravy (particularly balsamic vinegar).  I haven't used wine that often, but I am thinking that it works the best.

The next problem is that adding a slurry of stock and some thickener (corn starch, flour, or arrowroot are what I've normally tried), in my opinion, tends to mess up the flavor.  It's almost like you can taste the blandness of flour, arrowroot seems to impart a very weird sweet taste, and corn starch is just meh.  

By varying the amounts of deglazing agent, stock, and thickener I have come up with gravies that are better or worse, but few I would call outstanding (or nearly as good as a pan gravy I've made from pan drippings -- like from a turkey).  What I've started doing is skipping the thickener, and just deglazing and then adding a bit of stock and reducing.  However to get to the right consistency it seems that I need to reduce it A LOT, and only get a tiny bit of gravy for my effort.

12602,"Not sure how to word my question; it's a just a thought bouncing around in my head. Please consider all of human history, not just present and future. 
Here goes:

RHETORICAL QUESTIONS

Is war necessary at times? 

If yes, is it only acceptable when bringing freedom to people who would otherwise not have freedom? At what point is the death of innocent people an acceptable loss in the quest to defeat an evil power? Is the loss of innocent lives in war accepted without any kind of moral penalty?  Do we grant soldiers and trained killers permission to carry out these terrible acts, as long as we don't get our hands dirty?

Assuming you've followed my train of thought thus far:

We hate war. We say it is terrible and cruel and barbaric, yet we admit that at times in human history, it has only been through brute force, grand spectacle and loss of innocent lives that true positive change has occurred. The ""evil"" (ignoring a segue into subjective definition of evil) will always try to conquer with brute force; the ""good"", no matter how much contempt some may hold for war, must at times fight fire with fire, or the world would be a world of slavery.

We typically rally against losing our civil liberties in favor of security. We want security, but the preservation of liberty is typically held in highest esteem.

Is it hypocritical to fiercely oppose any loss of privacy or liberty in exchange for security, while at the same time we condone the willful taking of others' life and liberty in exchange for securing freedom? How do rationalize this? Do we have a right to do this? Does the noble goal justify the hypocrisy? Are we fine with it as long as we don't witness it directly?",-1,-1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I dozed off under the influence of Nyquil last night before putting the 13* week old puppy in her bathroom for the night... This morning at around 3am she peed on my bed and me. I woke up to wetness through all 3 blankets, stripped off the sheets, sopped up the mess in a fuzzy daze and fell back to sleep on the bare mattress, super disappointed in her - I thought she at least knew better than to pee in the bed. 

Then today during one of the many, many reluctant potty breaks outside with her, my older dog stole and subsequently barfed up 1/4 bag of chocolate chips in several locations on the carpet.  Luckily after puking it out he seems to be feeling better... but while cleaning that I managed to make it much worse, slinging it across my freshly-showered-and-changed self and more of the carpet.  I got it on my pants, on both my shirt and my sweatshirt and in my hair even! 

Then I knocked over a mug in the kitchen, breaking it, while I was rinsing out the rag.  After sweeping that up I finally changed into clean clothes and then immediately got snot on my shirt. I was such a mess, scrubbing chocolate vomit, sobbing, with a runny nose; and all the while the dogs are screaming from their crate/bathroom for me to let them out, as they'd been cooped up nearly all day.  The puppy has been shut up all day because I've been sleeping and otherwise I have to watch her constantly and run outside with her every 5 minutes when she rings her bell for no reason. Every time she drinks water I start to resent her, thinking she is doing it just so she can pee all over everything and make me drop everything to take her out.  She drinks so much water!  And when they are out and free to play she is just terrorizing the older dog, stealing anything he is chewing on and being a pest in general.

I want to explain to he/she/it that language evolves, and attempting to restrict the way it is used in order to resist change is ultimately pointless, because in less than one thousand years, English will be completely different.  Just attempt to read Old English.

This is one of the reasons I LOVE hip-hop.  Black English Vernacular changes yearly.  There is always new slang and new and innovative ways of saying things, for example, the word Trill (True + Real... and imagine how that could be used in writing, specifically poetry).  Standard English is restricted by tradition, taught in grade school and forced down our throats in high school and college, and ultimately enforced by dictionaries and grammar nazis.  They gave me a framework that I hate.

20068," It was interesting to here everyone's ideas on what Internet Spaceships will be like in 10 years.  I read everyone's posts and then I smoked a bunch of weed and this what I came up with:


 Obviously CCP is interested in expanding the role of planets.  Planetary Interaction on the Eve end combined with Dust 514 on console is a pretty novel idea and shows that they are willing to take some risks to make a cool game experience. They will also tap a new well with Dust: the console FPS gamer. Big money to made there.


 I think there is another game play type that they have many pieces in place for and that's the Civilization gamer. Planetary management could expand to include things like government type, with different government types having advantages and disadvantages. To take this even further, imagine spending more of the planets resources on education for the population t result in better research and manufacturing in POS's since capsuleers are wealthy and could recruit(kidnap, whatever) the best minds to work on the stations. There are a million ways this could go but basically just mash Civilization, sov, and planetary management together and you get a whole new, fairly deep, aspect of Eve that attracts one more niche gamer type.


 For the actual planet experience, Dust 514 will probably be moderately successful but I doubt it's the next Halo. Even so, I think CCP will take what they learn from Dust and combine the FPS aspect into Eve proper. You would train skills for FPS combat just as you would a ship. On the planets they would be FPS clones which you can download to from any station. Enemy alliances could drop clone factories onto your planets and you would have to fight to destroy their factory while they would fight to destroy your clone factory. If your clone factory gets destroyed then you can no longer protect your assets on the ground and materials production, research, whatever, would be disrupted, costing the alliance enough to make it worth protecting. 


 Of course there would have to be some type of matching system to make this work. I think something along the lines of hiring mercenaries to fight in your place when you aren't there would work. Mercenaries wouldn't be like merc corps are now though. It would have to be a separate system where you can pay X amount of ISK to have level 1 players battle for your side and X*10 to have the top tier players battle of your side. Essentially, whoever pays the most gets the most skilled FPSers to fight for them. Under this system, FPSers would just log onto there Xbox or PC and jump right into the game, oblivious to the alliance they are fighting for but alliance members could jump clone down and fight for their side. The pure FPS players (Dust players) would be able to buy faction guns and armor, etc, and alliances could put some of those new planetary resources to work producing guns for themselves. This could be expanded to include invading enemy titans as well though again there are some time frame issues to be worked out.


 Taking the long view, I think CCP wants to expand the audience that their games are attractive to(and thus get mo' money) and since they have said they want to turn Eve into the ultimate sci-fi game, I think we can look forward some interesting stuff coming to Eve in the future.

20088,"I work at a hospital posted outside right at the front door, so as you can imagine, I see all types.  And there's tons of HBs, I'm fortunate in that area.  I'm a recovering AFC but I've definitely learned a lot over the past few months after randomly picking up The Game by Neil Strauss (couldn't put it down), and reading Seddit.   I've had plenty of interactions, and I'm becoming more natural, but I still have a lot about myself I need to work on, mainly escalating.  Fear of rejection, possibly.  Working on that.  So while I'm in a good mood after reading some brilliant insight from LesbianPUA (link below) I thought I'd share what happened today.

There was a HB7 walking by all day going out for smoke breaks, and we definitely made eye contact at least once and I gave her the smile.  We've met before a few weeks ago when it was raining hard and she came out and smoked in the shelter.  We just small talked, as I was on the job and couldn't give her 100% attention.  Today she was in and out and over time I was finally able to go out for a smoke myself while she was out there.  I approached from an angle, my car was nearby so I made a pit stop to switch lighters.  I'm positive she saw me coming the minute I stepped away from post.  After my pit stop and walked straight over to her.  We chatted flirtatiously for about 10 minutes.  She was clearly interested.  At least that's how it looked to me any way.  Eventually, after negging her on her smoking habit, and discussing things we had in common, I told her that I was going to ask her out to lunch but I had missed her.  She said, ""OK, how about we meet out here again in an hour?""

""OK sounds good.""  Then we walked slowly back to the door talking for a while, then parted ways.

One hour passed but I didn't see her.  Then each minute after that got slower and slower.  Another hour passed and I still hadn't seen her.  It was time for me to go home, so I did.

What I'm thinking is that this is a good thing.  If she's interested in me now after weeks, why would she forget about me today?  It's possibly a shit test, and here's where I'm a little hazy.  She could be testing me to see if I'm just gonna hit it and quit it.  Currently the plan is to give her shit about flaking on me in a playful manner, using kino if possible.

Or I could be wrong and she's not interested.  But I have nothing to lose, so why not try again?

20117,"Recent finance grad here looking for some input - How do I break into finance if I have no professional experience?

My situation:

I graduated in May with a Bachelor's in finance and have been looking for employment since. Like many of my peers, I did not succeed in finding an internship my junior year. Due to obvious market circumstances coupled with a foolish mentality at the time of not wanting to settle for a position with a company I didn't really want to work for, I ended up with no experience. I see now that any relevant experience would've been invaluable even if the company name did not build my resume itself.

What I have done in the last six months:

I have combed through postings on career sites (Monster, Careerbuilder, etc.) and corporate career pages with no luck. I have created profiles with all the major finance staffing/temp firms in my area, only to hear back from one which has yet to come up with any position that fits my profile. I have contacted alumni from my school and have been met with little useful advice and no leads. 

I am beginning to think that finding a job will be a pure stroke of luck and has nothing to do with working hard to get there. I am running out of ideas as well as optimism. I have confidence in my career potential, but can't find a way to develop it. 

Why I'm posting this here:

Maybe someone here knows something I don't or has a piece of advice that could be useful. Maybe you're looking for someone like me. Maybe you are someone like me and this will give you solace in the fact that you're not alone.

20574,"Early next year I'll be changing my name to a more anglicized name than what I have now.  Been talking with a lawyer and already filed a formal petition and set up a court date.  I've thought about this for years and years and decided I wouldn't be at peace with my name until I changed it.  

My dad is neutral to my choice, while my mom isn't all too happy about it.  To be fair, she's probably disappointed because her grandchildren and descendants through me most likely won't have my dad's last name, but she didn't seem that sad or angry with all the prejudice and mistreatment I've gone through (even today) just because of how my name sounds in English.  Even if I let it all go, I never liked the sound of my name anyway and feel the new name I've chosen is better professionally.  

Some of my friends know, I haven't broken it to most however.  Some of my friends are really good friends and I'd let them call me by my birth name if they wished, other people can just screw off and either call me by my new name or not talk to me again.

Maybe some of my motivations are a bit questionable or ill-founded, but I take great solace when I don't have to lie when I say I'm not my old name.

I'm fully aware of what I'll need to do to get a new SS card, driver's license, update info at financial institutions, etc. and I'm fully prepared to take responsibility for such things.

Anyone who's changed their name willing to share their experience of adjusting after they changed their name?  Stories of altered relationships with other people, or any hassles with updating information at a lot of places?  I know it varies state by state, but my lawyer did say I can still use my old name as long as it's not to defraud.

21938,"I'll start out by saying some of you may think I'm a criminal or a bum because of my initial reluctance to pay the fine you are about to read about.  However, I'll have you know (sonny!) that i pay all of my other bills on time and only speed occasionally.  Also, I didn't think it would come to this... :-/

So, I currently drive a car registered in my wife's name (I am on the insurance).  Back in March, she received a letter from a company called SpeedSafe that operates red light &amp; speed cameras around the city we live in.  In the letter addressed to her it stated that she had been photographed speeding and needed to pay a fine of $35.  The letter included a picture of me driving the car.

Now, I used to work in law enforcement and I still have lots of cop buddies, most of which encouraged us to throw the letter in the trash and not pay them.  Many of us feel the cameras do not make us safer, do not prevent accidents, and most of all just creep us out in general (if not violate some kind of privacy rights or something).  The speed camera company in my city is a company contracted out by the city government to collect fines based on photographic evidence, and they are run by law firms that operate out of other states.  They have no ""legal"" authority, so you can't go to jail for not paying them, however they do have the ability to report the uncollected fines to credit bureaus.  In essence, they are simply debt collectors.  But I digress...

The letter stated she had three options: 1) pay the fine, or if she wanted to dispute the fine, 2) tell them why she was disputing it, or if she was not the person in the picture 3) send them the information of the person in the picture.  Naturally, she returned the letter with my information in the correct places asking them to remove her name from the ""fine"" and put mine in instead.  At this point, we probably should have just sent them the money but the only thing on her mind was getting her name off of this ""debt collection"" and I object to the whole idea of ""speed cameras"" in general so I wasn't going to send them money until I felt I had to.  Besides, what if we weren't husband and wife, and she had let a friend borrow her car?  She shouldn't have to pay the fine for her friend's speeding...

About 2 weeks later she gets a letter back from them stating that she needed to get a form notarized saying that I was the one who was in the picture, otherwise it wasn't a ""legal document"" and couldn't be used to remove her name and put mine in it's place.  On top of that, they tacked on a $40 ""late payment"" fee.  Well, that didn't sit well with her.  Why should she have to pay a notary fee to prove herself innocent?  Shouldn't *they* have to prove *her* guilty??  So at this point I took over and sent them a letter (acting as her) citing various parts of the Fair Debt Collection Act or whatever and demanding that they either refrain from sending any more correspondence regarding this matter OR take her to court, at which point she would clearly be shown ""innocent"" (since it's obviously not her in the picture) and she would counter sue for court costs, attorney fees, lost wages, and punitive damages.

Well, we never heard back from them so we figured they'd just decided it wasn't worth the trouble... until today.  We got a letter from a *different* law firm stating that we had a debt of $75 past due and needed to pay in full immediately.  Naturally I am going to send them the same letter I sent before, just edited slightly for relevance.  But, now I am left wondering:  Will they just keep selling the debt to other collectors and making her (me) dispute it each time??

At this point I feel like it's too late to just pay it since it will show as a ""late paid debt"" on her credit report, whereas if they just switch the debt to my name I couldn't give a shit less if mine shows it.

21956,"Playing Super Meat Boy made me remember how much I love timed jump and run games, but one thing always bothered me.
I kinda think leaderboards or highscores are stupid, both mean you just grind the same stage over and over until you get that one perfect run even though it could have taken you days it doesn't matter.
In my opinion it's way more interesting to see who gets the best time in only a few lives or under a time limit, maybe even on a brand new course.

Then it hit me, games like super meat boy need a multiplayer that works exactly like Trackmania.
2-24 player join a server, a certain stage starts and everybody gets 2-5 minutes depending on the stage to get the best time, points are awarded according to your placing and after 10-20 stages the player with the must points win (duh)

I think this would be a tremendously fun multiplayer, you may have the top score on a stage, but what when you have to act under time pressure?

The game was a fairly standard gem matching type thing with the following tweaks:

* I think it was set underground in a sort of maze, the aim was to match gems to remove the earth/rock they were set in, to allow a liquid (lava maybe?) to flow through the gem maze to reach some sort of goal/orb thing before a timer ran out. 
* Gems could be matched in any direction, they just had to touch. Using the mouse you could drag through any number of connecting gems and once you'd got past 3/4 there would be a small explosion at the final gem, blowing away more of the underlying rock, allowing the lava free passage.
* There were a number of different powerups, the only one I really remember was a shovel which allowed you to dig out some of the dirt to let the lava through to new areas.

The name is completely erased from my mind, I've spent a disturbing amount of time trolling through google images with different gem-matching related terms hoping to catch a glimpse of the correct type of game field but as yet no dice.

It's been almost 2 weeks, and I've had nothing but problems with her cat.

He is a big fluffy ugly cat, and he has urinated on my bed and on my clothes that I left out. (Why did I leave them out? because they are in a big tote and I left it open when I was in a hurry)

So how do I stop the cat from urinating on all my stuff? I feel like he's marking territory.

EXTORSIONAN A KÍNDERES CON AUTOPLAGIO

EL NORTE Monterrey, México (2 diciembre 2010).- Dos kínderes particulares del poniente de la Ciudad fueron blanco de una nueva e increíble forma de extorsión por parte de delincuentes.

Bajo amenazas, los criminales presuntamente obligaron a que dos grupos de maestras y niños se ""autoplagiaran"" en moteles por más de nueve horas, después de las cuales todos fueron localizados ilesos.

Con esta extorsión, los delincuentes recibieron 20 mil pesos, explicó ayer el director de la Agencia Estatal de Investigaciones (AEI), Adrián de la Garza.

Al confirmar las versiones que corrieron desde el martes por la noche, el mando policiaco dijo que los extorsionadores llamaron ese día por la mañana al Centro Infantil Pedro Infante de la Colonia Hacienda Santa Clara y a otra escuela del mismo nombre en la Colonia Barrio San Luis, en Ciudad Solidaridad.

Ambos planteles, que no están en zonas de alto nivel socioeconómico, son propiedad de una misma persona, que no fue identificada por De la Garza.

Las llamadas a los colegios, añadió el director de la AEI, fueron hechas el martes alrededor de las 11:00 horas por extorsionadores que convencieron a las maestras de que tenían gente armada afuera de los planteles y que podían entrar en cualquier momento si no accedían a sus peticiones.

En los dos casos, los delincuentes dieron nombres de alumnos que estaban en los salones, lo que causó mayor temor entre las maestras, que, de acuerdo al funcionario, no llamaron a la Policía.

Las instrucciones que dieron a las maestras suenan a guión de película.

A las educadoras del colegio ubicado en Hacienda Santa Clara les ordenaron que llevaran a niños al Supermotel, en la Avenida Rangel Frías, donde debían permanecer encerrados hasta nueva orden, dijo el jefe de la Ministerial.

Una orden similar fue dada al plantel de Ciudad Solidaridad, aunque les dijeron que fueran al motel Portobello, ubicado en la Colonia Ex Ejido San Bernabé.

En total, dijo De la Garza, 10 alumnos y ocho profesoras se ""autoplagiaron"" en los moteles.

Como rescate, agregó, el dueño de los colegios depositó 8 mil pesos a una cuenta de Banco Ahorro Famsa, mientras que familiares de una de las maestras depositaron 12 mil pesos en una cuenta de Banamex.

Los ministeriales se enteraron de las extorsiones por terceras personas y localizaron a alumnos y maestras en los moteles, alrededor de las 20:30 horas.

No obstante, indicó el funcionario, hasta anoche no se había presentado ninguna denuncia.

De la Garza pidió que las extorsiones se reporten a los teléfonos de la AEI: 2020-4590, 92 y 93.

Ayer en entrevista, una madre de familia dijo que, cuando otra de las mamás llegó el martes por la tarde a la escuela por sus hijos, encontró a las maestras llorando y le dijeron que tenían a los niños resguardados atrás debido a un ""altercado"" en un colegio aledaño.

Aunque hubo versiones de que se habría arrojado una granada a alguno de los kínderes Pedro Infante, esto no fue corroborado.

Los dos planteles extorsionados permanecieron ayer cerrados.

In this universe we are a possible consequence of this universe's constants, that I have no problem understanding. As to the fact that ours **is** the universe with these constants is harder to rationalise as even minute changes to any constant would result in it being impossible not only for cells to exist but even molecules. And it's not as if we can point to other universes of other constants and say that at least one of them would be hospitable akin to the hospitable planet argument.

I'm not saying that us humans are lucky to have the constants being what they are, I'm saying the possibility of any lifeform is impossible in most, if not all, other possible configurations of the constants.

3 months passed since August 19 and it was time for my essure verification to make sure my tubes are blocked.

Last Wednesday, I arrived little earlier than I expected so I had to wait 45 minutes until my appointment.

An hour before the exam, I took 500mg naproxen and 75mg fexmid. They were leftover from a car accident I was in back in October. I also wore gripping socks because from what I heard that all x-ray places have no stirrups.

The receptionist guided me to the dressing room. I removed my pants, wore a gown and waited in the tiny room with other people. 5 minutes later, the tech came and called me. She explained me about the procedure and some questions. She basically said the procedure would probably take between 15 to 30 minutes because it depends on the angle of my  cervix. She showed me a few things - iodine, x-ray dye, swabs, plastic speculum, and [cannula, catheter with syringe](http://www.v2.redi-tech.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/hsg.jpg). I made a face when I saw the cannula because it was huge like a pencil! She said I will feel little pain and moderate cramps. 

The radiologist came in and greeted me. I laid on the cold, hard table with a pillow under my head. The speculum was inserted. He applied a swab with iodine into my cervix. The tech held my left leg and I felt a sharp pain when the cannula was inserted into my cervix but it went away in 2 seconds. I thought it was nothing... until the injection of the dye. The pain took me by surprise. My eyes welled up and my legs trembled. The pain scale between 1 to 10 for my cramps on period is 4 but this pain is 12! It was intense like.. a thousand of needles stabbing in my uterus. I could only imagine what it felt like to be kicked down there if I was a guy.

The pain subsided but the radiologist injected again. Argh, the pain came back again. I thought I was going to pass out because I was feeling very light-headed. That moment, I wanted to kick his face! I grasped my jacket, I covered my eyes and held my breath. The tech came to me, held my hand and said ""It is okay. It is almost done."" She asked me to roll to the left then to the right and in the fetal position too.

Everything took only five minutes but I felt like much longer than that. The tech told me to rest a little bit. I had an awkward moment with the radiologist. He asked me why did I have essure? He thought I was too young. I simply told him that I don't want kids. He was kind of appalled. He walked out without saying goodbye or a handshake. I was glad he asked me after that because he could refuse to do the procedure if he knew before that. The tech apologized but she gave me great news that I'm 100% blocked. YAYYYYYY! :D She said I can lay down for ten minutes or until I am ready to go but I told her that I am definitely ready to leave. I didn't want to lay down because I live 2 hours away and I wanted to beat rush hour. The tech was little concerned and wanted to make sure I'm not dizzy or light-headed. I kept telling her that I am perfectly fine and I don't have cramps. She gave me a pad and wet wipe. I was fine but the hard part was walking. My legs were still shaking but I managed to get out of the building with my SO.

I didn't have cramps except feeling bloated from dye. It discharged after few hours. 

Yesterday and today, I feel little pulling sensation in my uterus but besides that, I'm great. No bleeding or pain. 

I didn't have a chance to see my x-ray but I found three examples on google.

I've worked in three different cognitive psychology labs studying the nature of visual attention, memory and cognition.

The kind of research we do is published in reputable peer reviewed journals like Nature Neuroscience and Cognition.  
 
Now to me, all this seems fairly scientific to me.  Yet I often see arguments that psychology is not a science. I believe this is a big, ugly over-generalization, but it frustrates me that the general perception of psychology -- including scientific thinkers who should know better -- is that we're a bunch bobble-headed Freudians and fluffy Deanna Trois.  Not that those types shouldn't necessarily have a place in psychology, but the fact they dominate public perception does bother me a bit.  I've come to the point where I describe myself as a student of cognitive science rather than psychology, despite the fact that I will most likely be getting my PhD in psychology.

When the guests (a transgender guy and girl) were introduced, he pointed out their previous genders (with such choice phrases as ""He's really a she!

So today marks another foray by an Asian actor (Jang Dong-gun in “The Warrior’s Way”) into the interracial miasma that is Hollywood. Unlike the upcoming movie “Green Hornet” where Jay Chou plays the beta Asian to Seth Rogen’s lead role, the lead role in “The Warrior’s Way” is that of an Alpha Asian.

It even has Kate Bosworth in the first Asian Man White Woman interracial movie kiss in years (assuming they even kiss). That’s a rare occurrence in the media if there ever was one: like a unicorn or a pot of gold at the end of a rainbow is the Alpha Asian Man.

If I sound jaded and skeptical, it’s because I am. Especially when it comes to anything regarding Asian men in mainstream media. I almost never saw any positive and masculine Asian male role models growing up. And if you haven’t figured it out, this article isn’t really a movie review so much as a review of the current state of Asian Masculinity as we approach the closing days of 2010 here in the 21st century.

After an angst ridden college career, I simply stopped caring what occurred on TV and in the movies. So I moved on and started trying to be my own hero (which is like building a sandcastle when the tide is coming in, but that’s another story). Nowadays, when I ask my students who is the most positive and masculine Alpha Asian role model they can think of, they all invariably reply with Bruce Lee!

An awesome role model and Alpha Asian, to be sure with his philosophical synthesis of the martial arts and media prowess, but the man has been dead for like 30 years!!! That’s just sad (and no, Jackie Chan doesn’t and Chow Yun Fat only counts overseas).

And somehow along the way, I- that rapscallion dandy and pickup artist, the Asian Playboy- became that Alpha Asian role model to thousands of other Asian Americans (and Asians in Great Britain to Australia). A heavy responsibility and a role I’m not entirely certain why I was thrust into, but here I am anyways. A servant to a deep cultural need that no one else was fulfilling.

For example, here’s one fanmail that moved me deeply, from Huy (personal details changed):

Dude. I’m a first generation America Vietnamese kid born in the ghettos of Los Angeles. I just graduated now I am proudly serving the nation as a tank driver and American Soldier stationed in [redacted] with the [redacted] division. I just wanted to say that you’re my hero =] you helped me believe that I could amount to something more than nail salons and pho restaurants.

- HUY (Los Angeles, California)

It moves me because I have to ask, who the hell am I to be anyone’s hero much less someone who risks their lives everyday?!

I just teach guys how to be successful with women. I don’t save lives. Hell, William the Better Asian Man is out there saving real lives as a weekend volunteer for the FDNY. I just help my Asian brothers go out there and get laid with just about any women they want out there.

This kid here is actually going to be out there on the FRONT LINES protecting our freedoms with his life and he thinks *I’m* a hero?!

Anyways, I think being a role model to thousands of men around the world in order become their own Alpha Asian has forced me to find other sources of role modeling, from my own mother to the spiritual teachings of the Buddha. But at the same time, looking back on my own formative years, it would have been of great help to see me, my own reflection and values, in others as they would see themselves.

And that’s where the media comes in.

Although I still contend that changing the media won’t have that big of an effect on AMs as many seem to believe, it’s still heart warming to see and has turned what was simply a guilty pleasure into one of my favorite TV shows, Glee, and see Harry Shum playing another potential Alpha Asian, Mike Chang. As his character arc progresses, I see many positive traits that I think other Asian boys, in the cusp of manhood, should emulate in order to be more confident, masculine, sexual, successful and ultimately the Alpha Asian they were meant to be.

While I haven’t seen the movie “The Warrior’s Way” yet (I’ve got my LAST bootcamp of 2010 to run this weekend after all), I do hope to catch it on Monday to properly review it and I do hope it doesn’t suck as so many other movies before it has (like Jet Li’s non-kiss in “Romeo Must Die” with Aaliyah). Yes, it’s another chop-socky, kung fu, ninja movie (like Jung “Rain” Ji-Hoon in “Ninja Assassin“), but I hope there are definite masculine, Alpha Asian characteristics in “The Warrior’s Way” that those of us who didn’t grow up with strong role models we can identify with.

So let me put forward my own list of what I contend are “Alpha Asian” characterstics that I hope to see in this movie “The Warrior’s Way” and other movies and TV shows, whether it’s John Cho in Star Trek to Daniel Dae Kim in the rebooted Hawaii Five-0.

An Alpha Asian Male is:

1) Athletic: The Alpha Asian plays competitive sports like football, basketball, and other full contact activities.
2) Creative: The Alpha Asian plays music, writes, draws, and is non-traditional nor a conformist.
3) Physical: The Alpha Asian understands his body whether it comes from dancing or working out.
4) Sexual: The Alpha Asian enjoys sex and believes women will enjoy it with him as well.
5) Cultured: The Alpha Asian understands where he came from and why it’s important.
6) Multicultural: The Alpha Asian is open to other cultures, whether it’s America to Europe to Ethiopians.
7) Compassionate: The Alpha Asian is compassionate and caring to his fellow brothers and sisters.
8) Assertive: The Alpha Asian is a leader and will speak up and act out when appropriate.
9) Dominant: The Alpha Asian will take charge, from the board room to the bedroom.
10) Courageous: The Alpha Asian understands fear, embraces it, and then moves forward despite it.

A wishlist to be sure, but here’s hoping that some good can come out of these movies. That some teenage Asian kid, unlike me those many moons ago, will be uplifted by seeing an Alpha Asian role model and push himself beyond his comfort. To be successful not only at school, but in his personal life and life in general.

Because ultimately, the mark of an Alpha Asian- the mark of any real man- is not his college education or his grades. It’s his ability to press on in the face of failure and fear no matter how many times he’s derided and insulted in order to accomplish his goals.

31132,"Ok, about me up to this point. I had several friends and a girlfriend whom I loved, that all ended up backstabbing me because I wasn't who they wanted me to be, or ""cool"" enough. After that I ended up friendless. I started visiting sites like omegle to chat with strangers so as to not to feel lonely. At omegle I made lot of friends with whom I used to chat with everyday. There I met a girl who wasn't from my country. I started chatting with her everyday. I liked chating with her and she too was very kind and caring. I started loving her, but when I expressed it to her she refused. I understand her decision considering I am almost a stranger to her. But I loved (love) her from the core of my heart. I am the kind of person who doesn't like fooling around with girls. I just want to get into one serious relation which would go on to the end, but I am sick that I loved someone the second time.

32994,"So there was this fourth century sect called the Gnostics. They believed that the God of Genesis - let's call him Jehovah - was a peculiar, deluded, narcissistic fool, who had wrongly convinced himself that he was the one and only God. They said: ""This is the first archon who took a great power from his mother.... And he is impious in his arrogance which is in him. For he said: 'I am God and there is no other God beside me,' for he is ignorant of his strength, the place from which he had come.""

Jehovah desired nothing more than to be glorified, but self-glorification leads to sweaty palms and unnatural hair growth. So he created beings with free will, in order that they could glorify him one-on-one and in small and large groups. Like the Republicans who would come after him, he believed free will could be controlled through the widespread application of ignorance. Then one day, the actual supreme God, whom Gnostics call the Unknowable God, experienced an unknowable thing that we might describe as wanting to put an end to the ridiculous Jehovah situation. So she sent her emissary, the serpent, into the Garden of Eden. The serpent taught mankind the truth, and mankind turned away from the miserable old fool Jehovah.

Jehovah, of course, was filled with vengeance and furious anger. He regretted creating mankind and wanted to destroy it. But Jehovah had required beings who could operate independently of himself, which meant their free will must emanate from a power beyond Jehovah's reach. Jehovah had unwittingly imbued each of his creations with a direct connection to the Unknowable God. Unable to erase free will, he instead filled men's souls with temptation, evil and sin, which he hoped would add so much noise that the signal from the Unknowable God would be overwhelmed.

From another, or perhaps the same, unknowable motivation, the Unknowable God continued to send emissaries such as Elijah, Moses, Buddha, Jesus and Mohammed, to reveal the truth and call on the people to listen to the signal, not the noise. Jehovah, of course, continues to try with all his might to discredit and destroy these emissaries, even going so far as to crucify one of them and spin crazy tales about blood sacrifice and eternal torment. But in fact, each and every one of us is independently able to connect to the true perfection. All we have to do is stop listening to Jehovah.

36523,"Totally unsolicited. You may or may not agree. However, I know a few of you in person, and I'm an observant person, so here goes:

First and foremost, DON'T BE A TROLL. Seems simple and obvious, don't it? If you're chatting with a girl, don't try to goad her with how much you know or how much she doesn't. Don't revert to sixth grad 'I hit you I like you' type behavior. 

Second: Never, ever talk about being 'forever alone' with girls- whether you're attracted to them or not. It's fine to chat with friends about wanting to find someone, that you're lonely, etc. Where guys get into trouble is actually being self-deprecating. It's not a good attitude to have, and even if you aren't attracted to the girl you're talking like this to, remember this: girls know other girls. A lot of times, girls *like* to hook up single friends together. And I know from experience- mine and others- that we don't want to hook a girlfriend up with someone bearing that attitude. 

Third: have a sense of humor about dating. If you don't, you'll self destruct in no time. If you fail, and fail hard- take a step back and realize how idiotic and silly dating is. Everyone fails. If someone does something idiotic, mean, or rude- like ditch you- try your best to laugh about it, realize they're a bitch/cunt/not worth your time, and move on. which leads me to..

Fourth: Approach a date with the expectation to have fun, not to fall in love. If you've managed to score a date with someone who intrigues you- mentally, physically, or -gasp!- both- head out looking forward to getting to know them. It's sexy when a guy is having a good time, and it's obvious when they're expecting something later on. 

Fifth: to meet girls you'll like, try meeting them in places YOU like. If you're a huge dork, go to lectures or other events (dorkbot, tech parties, etc). Conventions or lectures or other 'extracurricular' activities are great places to meet girls who are into the same general things you are. Start up a conversation. Be casual. I've always been much more receptive to random conversations during these daytime or casual get-togethers than bars, clubs, or fancier parties.

and here's one more thing about first dates: Movies are shitty first dates. Don't get to fancy, either. A walk, bike ride, or other mostly-unstructured activity where you can chat is a great idea. Why unstructured? If there's no spark, you don't have to suffer through the rest of the dinner/day/activity. You can just laugh it off, realize there's no connection, and go home. 

That's about it. I'm happy to give more advice (hah) if you ask for it. For some info: I'm a 26 year old super geeky lady. I started a soft-circuit company, teach electronics, and am learning programming. I am also a cartoonist and a trekkie. 

TL;DR:

1. don't act like a troll

2. forever alone attitude is unsexy

3. laugh it off

Edit:  Thanks for all your amazing comments.  They mean a lot!  I am starting to rethink the tattoo idea just because I'm still losing!  I just feel like I need to commemorate this amazing milestone!  Any ideas?

Edit:  Hey guys, thanks for all the amazing comments.  I'm getting a lot of questions and I'll try and answer some.

How I did it:  Initially when I was really overweight, I just did cardio and limited my caloric intake. This was good for dropping weight fast. However, I realize that it isn't the proper way to do it. I did a ridiculous amount of research and currently I go to the gym three times a week where I do 30 mins of cardio(elliptical); 45 mins of weight training and then 20 minutes of stretching. I've discovered weight training is key, it increases your metabolism and you continue to burn calories for 24 hours after. I make healthier food choices but I don't completely restrict myself. I don't kill myself because I had a bad weekend. Just get back on the horse and continue. I've gotten to a point where I feel crappy if I haven't been to the gym in a few days, it limbers you up and makes you feel good. 

Maintaining: since I'm still losing, I'm not in the maintaining stage yet.  Some days are worse than others and I just want something deliciously bad for me and some days I have to drag my ass out of bed.

How I ended up so big:  I had dropped out of University and was working as a manager at Mcdonalds (constitutes free food) and even though the job was physically demanding, I did nothing at home, zero exercise and over ate like no one's business.  Looking back at it, I don't how I let myself get that big.  I blame depression mostly.

No surgery!  All hard work.

If anyone has some good links on training diets, I would appreciate it.  I'm looking to take it to the next level.

I liked buying ships to add to my fleet and going around and selling cargo and fucking up pirates and stuff. That's basically what I'm looking for.

I've really liked Sins of a Solar Empire too. Again, I liked being able to buy ships and create massive fleets. It's not really the kind of game I'm looking for right now though. You know, it's all RTS-y all the time, and you have to defeat the enemy to win. I want a bit more openness to it.

39326,"Lately there has been some ballyhoo about the particulars of ""downvoting stuff you disagree with"". Some suggestions for consideration:

* **Don't upvote just because you ""agree"", either. Use the same standards for upvoting that you do for downvoting: does this add to the discussion? Is it smart, new, thought-provoking, interesting, entertaining, informative? Reckless upvoting is just as circle-jerky as knee-jerk downvoting is.**

* Reddiquette is not official policy or rules or terms of service. It's suggestions on how to make reddit a better place, written by users. 

* Downvotes can and should be used be used as a democratic ""ban"" on bad content, and content that detracts from or fails to add value to a discussion. 

* There is no reason not to downvote content or comments that are dishonest, misleading, or factually wrong. Redditors should feel free to exercise reasonable judgement as to whether something ""adds to the discussion"". 

* Sometimes even mistaken or wrongheaded comments can and do add to the discussion and quality of reddit by offering thoughtful and/or substantive articulations of common misconceptions. Responding to those posts with high-quality rebuttals is better than downvoting them, both because it generally increases the quality of the discussion, and because it helps prevent having dozens or hundreds of sub-threads all hashing out the same arguments. 

* Stupid or counter-productive comments are just as bad as, if not worse than, ""wrong"" arguments, even if they are ""on the right side"". They should be downvoted, even if they come from ""your team"", for the same reasons as above. They pollute, rather than add to the discussion. 

* **Try to apply the same up/downvote standards to both submissions AND comments.** Be sure to upvote good submissions, not just good comments, and DON'T upvote low-quality submissions just because they are about pot or wikileaks or making fun of christians or sticking it to feminists or whatever. Not everything you agree with improves the quality of reddit. 

* Consider making heavy use of the ""non-vote"" option, especially for submissions/comments that you have not actually read or understood. Allow redditors with the time to read them to moderate the content that you're just skimming. 

* Long posts may have a lot of points, some good, some bad. Vote with care, and consider a reply if it is more appropriate than a downvote ""ban"".

* Occasionally, you will find yourself upvoting a comment or article, and then reading a comment that appears to successfully rebut it. Consider letting the original upvote stand, and then upvoting the rebuttal, as well. Sometimes the best content is rigorous debate, and if you were persuaded by one good argument, and then persuaded by an even better counter-argument, then *both* of those might actually be helping to make reddit better. 

**Use your reddit powers for good, to help make reddit the best place to find good-quality content online.** Upvote stuff that is thought-provoking, intelligent, new, interesting, informative, and entertaining. Downvote stuff that is dumb, circle-jerky, tedious, misleading, badly-sourced, spammy, or repetitive. Imagine that you are the editor-in-chief of the entire internet, and that each upvote means ""this makes it to the internet"" and that each downvote means, ""this is trash and should be excluded from the internet"". Consider yourself as having a certain amount of journalistic responsibility to use your powers judiciously-- not to dictate what people should see and think, but to make sure that the best-quality stuff is put out there for consideration.

So I'm at the bar with some friends and this woman I've been flirting with for a couple weeks (I don't see her very often) comes in with her friends. We chat for a couple minutes as we're getting beers, but always part back our groups. Finally around 11 p.m. all of my friends leave. It's a non-smoking bar so I step outside to have a cigarette. As I come back in she, we'll call her A, asks, ""Do you want to go for a smoke?""

In that second I hear the voice of David Wygant say, ""You have to make moments.""

me: I just had a smoke...

A: Oh (disappointed)

me: But I 've got some bud and I know a concealed area out back if you want to smoke. (Look at my name, what you do expect)

A: Really? lets go.

So we go out back and toke up. We're flirting back and forth with mutual Kino going on. We go back out front and have a cigarette and one of her friends, we'll call her B, grabs A's arm and says, ""We need to go.""

A: But I'm talking to [me]

B: No we need to go now

A: Sorry [me] I guess I have to go

This was about 12:30 a.m.

I give her a little pat and said I'd get in touch with her.

So I wake up this morning and there's a text message waiting for me from A saying, ""Sorry I had to leave, B saw the guy I've been going out with making out with my best friend.""

me: No problem and that's fucked up. You shouldn't have to worry about your boyfriend and best friend going at each other

A: Oh he's not my boyfriend, I actually don't even like him that much so I'm not worried about it. We'll have to get together soon and swap bud

me: You doing anything tonight

A: I'm going to [local ski resort] with some friends, but if we're back not too late I'll let you know

me: sounds good

I'm thinking that the text conversation may have ended not as well as it should have with her getting a hold of me, but I had hardly woken up and wasn't quite there, but I think things are going ok. I just have to make sure I don't lose momentum

40899,"Hi guys - I've recently discovered Fitit (having only recently discovered Reddit too), and I am genuinely amazed at the wealth of useful information here relating to fitness/weight loss/weight training etc etc. 

I've been generally reading around, and I've taken a look at the FAQ and some related links, however I've a couple of questions, if anyone would be able to take the time to help me out a bit!

**Some Background**

I have, in the past, been able to keep up a fairly basic workout schedule, which had little structure, and consisted of something along the lines of:

- 10-20 minutes cardio
- Doing particular muscle groups, with little regularity as to which ones were done on specific days

This yielded some results, however I'm now looking to go for something which is a bit more effective.

**Now - the questions:**

*Cardio*

It seems that a fair few programs are based on about 3 lifting-based workouts a week, on non-consecutive days. However, how does this tie into cardio? Is it acceptable to, for example, do 30/40 minutes of cardio in the days inbetween? The reason I ask, is because I would not only like to achieve a low body fat percentage (and I realise that weights will burn a lot of calories and help with this), but eventually, would also like to be able to increase my endurance somewhat. 

*Types of programs to follow*

From what I've read, it seems that Mark Rippletoe's Starting Strength is often recommended as a great beginner program. However, looking at the JohnStoneFitness site (linked as a great transformation in the FAQ), it seems that his initial workouts were more based upon different, non-compound lifts on non-consecutive days, with cardio in the days inbetween? I guess this ties into my above question, but is either of these ways particularly better than the other?

That's pretty much all I've got to ask, at the moment. Apologies if I'm failing miserably at understanding all of this, although I'd hugely appreciate it if someone could clear up any misconceptions I have so far :D

Thanks in advance, Fitit!

There is at least an albums worth of photos, and money for this is not limitless, the photos range in age from the 1990s to World War II, maybe some older, maybe some younger, as far as I know they would all qualify as being in good condition.

This is great in theory, however - the toilets are complete crap. The restricted flow rate is accomplished by some kind of bucket in the toilet tank that severely restricts how much water can actually go down the flapper. 

The end result is every time I pee, I flush the toilet 3-4 times. Every time I poop, it's 5-6 flushes. This winds up not only pissing me off, but wasting far more water than if the damn toilet just worked properly to begin with. I asked at Lowe's and they told me that the bucket thing is pretty much built in, and I would have to replace the toilet to fix the problem. I can't replace the toilet because I'm renting. 

The first flush will only move maybe 1/2 of the fecal matter down the pipe, and the rest backflows into the bowl. I think it is something like 0.6 or 0.8 gallons per flush. It is a stupid fucking idea, and I wind up having to use so much more water just to flush away one bowel movement. 

I don't really have a point, I just am beyond irritated with having to plunge it yet again today and wanted to vent. Very low volume toilets are CRAP.

45786,"Hey,

I'm from Canada (Toronto) and I'm thinking about going to California for the first time. SF/Bay Area looks like the place for me (LA not so much). Only US city I've been to NYC, plus a few other eastern cities in Canada, but I've never been to the west coast, or anywhere remotely ""warm"".

I've read [a few threads](http://www.google.com/search?q=site:reddit.com+inurl:bayarea+OR+inurl:sanfranciso+OR+inurl:sanjose+OR+inurl:oakland+visiting) already and checked out Tripadvisor and Wikitravel.  Still looking for some advice though.

* Planning for something between Sat Jan 1 - Fri Jan 7, but I'm pretty flexible. I don't really know whether to stay 1, 2 or 6 days. Trying to find the right balance. What's this time of year like there?

* I don't drive, my entire trip will be on public transit. I hear you guys have decent transit.

* Travelling alone. (Wouldn't mind meeting someone for a beer or two.)

* I try to see pro sports teams when I travel. Hockey is my thing. I really want to go to a Sharks game (they play Vancouver on Mon Jan 3, Buffalo on Thu Jan 6, Nashville on Sat Jan 8). But SJ is quite a ways away from SF, and I'm not sure how long I should stay there. 

* My thought is to plan my trip around the game, where I'd stay in SJ for one night near the end of the trip and fly home out of there. I don't think it'd be worth it to stay in SF and take the 2h+ train there and back (but maybe I'm wrong).

* Most of the things I've read are about SF. What other parts of the Bay Area should I visit, keeping in mind that I won't have access to a car. Would it be worth it to try something where I start in SF, and ride CalTrain south, and get off occassionaly? 

* Worth it to stop and/or stay nights in Palo Alto, Mountain View, Santa Clara, etc? (I've never been to a US college campus, maybe I'd check out Stanford.) Or should I stay in one place and make day trips out of this?

* I probably have a misconceived view of this, but I'd like to see ""Silicon Valley"", whatever that means. The [Computer History Museum](http://www.computerhistory.org/hours/) is unfortunately closed for renovation until Jan 13. Is there anything else touristy like this for a techy? Is this museum so amazing that I should postpone my trip for a week to see it?

* I will tolerate museums and sightseeing tours when I'm playing tourist, but after the first day or two I really prefer to wander around, explore, ride the subway, get good food, coffee, beer, etc.

* I prefer the city, but I'd be a bit disappointed if I didn't get outdoors-natural-type sightseeing while on the west cost. I was looking at Tripadvisor, thinking about getting one of the shuttle/tours to Muir Woods.

* I like to bike (credentials: I commute to work, and I rode through Manhattan as a tourist and didn't die), and hear it's awesome in the SF area, but NYC/Toronto is flat and the hills will likely kill me. Also, the weather in January might not be the best. Should I still try anyway? Any of the other Bay Area cities besides SF amenable to biking in January?

So, any ideas, suggestions, thoughts... all very welcome.

**edit:** Thanks for the response. So far I'm hearing I should leave SJ/hockey to the end of the trip, not to bother with ""Silicon Valley"", stay in SF as long as possible, and not to miss Alcatraz.",-1,-1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I am a 22 year old male. I've been fortunate enough to have a family that is upper-middle class, and that supports me no matter what. I was given the choice of going to college anywhere in the world and I chose the US over any other place because I truly believe is has the best university system in the world and its universities are among the most recognized in any field. Since my family owns a business of warehouses and distribution I didn't want to go that  far off the field so I chose to become a finance major. I'm a senior now and I can't say I don't like my major but it is not what I really am excited about, I've found that the entrepreneurship aspect of it is one of the parts that moves me. The internet is the other thing that love. I've always loved computers but I wasn't smart enough to become a programmer (hate algebra and calculus, like the coding languages aspects of it, though).

Well long story short I wanted to know what are the steps to become a decent webmaster, I want to know all about website creation, maintenance as well as search engine marketing and optimization. I'm kind of looking for like online classes because I don't live in a major city (tiny college town) or something along those lines. I've already done some research in my university, and all they offer is a frontpage course, which I don't think will do for what I want. I want to be able to make professional grade website, possibly a store or even just an articles site that profits from ads who knows. The thing is that I want to get into this field.

50376,"There has been a lot of articles recently dealing with the fact that girls are experiencing more bullying in schools, and that cliques are forming at a younger age. 

Now, I agree with the fact that girls are being sexualized and put into groups at younger ages, and it probably has an influence on what kind of people they will grow up to be.

But as far as girls being bullied more? I don't feel like this is anything new. Think about it, its not special. If a boy ever brought a doll to school, you bet your tits he'd get his ass beat. The reason there are more instances of girls getting made fun of for having ""boyish"" things/clothes, is because its becoming more acceptable in the household to allow them to discover their interests despite gender. And these girls are bringing it to school, because they've been taught it is okay at home. Ten years ago, girls were always told that they were to play with dolls, and the cars were for their brothers. That was how it was, and that was how they grew up.

Now, I'm not saying that we should all make sure our girls wear frilly dresses and play Barbie (Lord knows I loved Legos and video games when I was a little girl. It probably explains why I get along better with guys, even to this day.) I'm just saying that the whole bullying thing is being blown out of proportion. 

**TL;DR** Girls aren't being bullied more because they're getting meaner, they're getting bullied more for not conforming. Just like boys always have been.

51223,"Hello all redditors and passing by readers:)

We are all I think are up to date about wikileaks, about all those documents being published. It's all over the internet,  news - everywhere.

I read some of the stuff wikileaks published in details, but since there are SO MANY of those things to go through, I pick up only ones which are interesting for me personally (about the country I live in..or smth like that).
I guess in those ""cables"" - almost everyone can find something ""interesting"" about the place and government where they live.

BUT

Here is a question which is now growing more and more in my head…

There were ton's of reactions from the media, many many people support wikileaks, many hate. Published documents vary from bizarre government ""crimes"" to insignificant mischief:)) 

BUT = WHAT'S NEXT? 

If there is a proof (which has to be checked of course and double checked and so on…but at least there is a ""direction"" in which to look for the truth) - where is justice? Who will take this information which wikileaks provides and DO SMTH with it to - punish those who are guilty or honor those who are innocent…

Cause if things will go on like they are now….soon - wikileaks won't matter anymore. We will all know that it's a website which posts truth which is too ""big"" and scary to be used for bringing justice. And it may just fade into the void where it keeps on fighting against a huge, brick wall with bare hands...

So, what you think, will those materials lead to something different then only the increase of security in governments? Will wikileaks be able to really change things they are or this media boom will just fade out with time?

P.s. I'd like to clarify, that I'm not looking into bringing one specific country to pay for smth it did wrong:) I was born in one country, now I live in another - and I saw some stuff about both of the governments behaving inhuman, cowardly, ruining lives of many (or helping others with doing so). And I don't feel pity for them if they are brought to justice one day and it makes no difference if this is my motherland or not. I don't want to be a part of the country which can kill others for nothing or for ""my well being"" as they say. 

If I knew how much will be stolen or how many will be killed after I vote for a guy - I might not vote for him.

I understand that Wikileaks aims for transparancy in the government, and it's great that they're releasing all this information that allows us to see what the government is really up to. But this release of key national security targets might not be the best idea; it's giving terrorists an idea of where to strike because now they know exactly what would hurt the US. 

I'm not saying Wikileaks is a bad thing, I think it's great. So don't kill me on this opinion. However, I thought they would be releasing information that would not directly harm anyone. This sounds like it might just do that.

It seems to get a bad rap for the most part, though (BeerAdvocate ratings aside).  It's usually either not mentioned when people discuss Trappist ales (It's always, Rochefort, and Westvleteren--still haven't had a chance to try this, but so badly want to-- being praised, with Westmalle being a close second, Chimay being snubbed for ""selling out"", and Achel being completely forgotten--for good reasons, let's admit it, their offerings are mostly average-- and La Trappe (Koningshoeven) being ignored, due to it not being a Belgian trappist--but the tripel is simply amazing on tap, and quadrupel almost as awesome from corked bottles).

Even the Wikipedia entry seems to poke fun at it, and I quote:

* Orval Trappist Ale, 6.2% ABV, often referred to as The Queen of Trappists. It was first made in 1931, and has a complex and unusual flavor and aroma produced by a unique strain of yeast. The beer is light in color, slightly cloudy, and has a large, foamy head. There is a **complex aroma of leather, horse blanket**, spice, and many other earthy components.

Emphasis mine.

To be fair, they could be right, as I've never drank leather or horse blankets (Except for that one expired tetra pack of Campbell's beef broth.  Perhaps that's a story for some other time), but let's be honest, if you're out to try a new beer, this sort of description would probably not sway it in your favour.

In my opinion, it's, as I've mentioned, very citrus-like, with a bitter, perhaps slightly chalky aftertaste (damn, that doesn't sound as appealing either, does it?).  The citrus is what lingers the most, however, and it's quite pleasant.  It almost reminds me of non-fruit infused lambics... perhaps even a flemish red, but without the complexity or sour notes.

51546,"We have a [neutered male] 15-month-old cat and two [neutered male] six-month-old kittens (littermates). We are also currently fostering two [10-week-old Russian Blue/DSH mix kittens](http://imgur.com/aezoK), who are females and are littermates, as well. As you can imagine, with so many young kitties, things are a bit hectic. They all get along very well and are very affectionate with us and with each other, but they are also all mischievous. We don't really mind the rampant destruction, as we intentionally buy either tough/washable or totally disposable furniture. We look past the foster kittens' occasional litterbox mishaps- they are very little, and were separated from their mother, so our cats are teaching them, and they are doing very well. Still, we call the girls ""Stinky"" and ""Tinkles"" for obvious reasons.  

Before the foster kittens came along, our cats would sometimes make toilet paper nests, but it was not a frequent enough behavior to be cause for concern. We simply put the paper back on the roll and moved on with our day. Furthermore, the nests were never built far from their sources. Lately, we keep finding the litterboxes, which we keep in the den, living room, kitchen, and bedroom, filled with toilet paper/paper towel nests. It is really gross and difficult to clean these up, as the litterboxes are still, um, used after the nests are built. Has anyone else had this happen after introducing new cats, or could it be unrelated? We introduced slowly and properly, and have not observed any spats between any of the kitties. They groom each other, cuddle, and play. 

As a side note, if anyone in the the DC/VA/MD metro area is interested in adopting the girls, please PM me to set up a time to come see them. If you don't mind having to be a bit patient with them (they are no more taxing than any other kittens this age), they would be a great addition! They are very cat-friendly and are super-cuddly with people, as well. Sorry for the plug, but we are just having trouble finding an adopter to take both, and we'd prefer not to separate them.

Now, something that really bothers me is when it calls itself a 'Driving Simulator'. GT games are not driving simulators and if they were most people would not find them interesting to play.


Having played countless racing games, I favour particularly the GTR series (the first was the best imho), iRacing and rFactor. These games are true driving simulator with meaningful settings and accurate driver's input required. No question to play without force feedback wheel/pedals and shifter - and you would be greatly disadvantaged not to have a clutch pedal to match.


And there lies the problem for most gamers, these games are not intrinsically fun to play but aim at providing a realistic experience. At their first attempts, most players end up crashing in every single corners. Scoring decent lap times will require a huge amount of efforts, which will be too much for most.


[Top Gear recently put Greger Huttu, best iRacing driver who never drove a race car in his life, into a Star Mazda racer and he laped the track at less than 3s (1:24.8) below very solid times, the telemetry showing perfects braking points.](http://www.topgear.com/uk/photos/geek-rebooted-2010-11-26)

 
I challenge anybody playing GTs to come anywhere close to this, because the game doesn't allow for acquiring this kind of skills. GT5 is not a driving simulator.


**TL:DR. Played and enjoyed most GT games. If GT5 was a simulator, most people would not find it fun to play. GT5 is a great game but it is not a simulator.**

And well... honestly guys, I must admit I still cling to the iPhone a bit. ""It's not that bad!"", said positive-me, after tons of things that annoy me to no end and *can't be fixed* by myself. I remember a comic with a comparison between iOS and Android - if it's a ""No"" on iOS, expect it to stay a ""no"" until... well, possibly forever.

List of things that are just WTF for me on iOS come a bit long, but recently I discovered that I can't actually set ""Auto-lock"" to ""Never"" if I have a Microsoft Exchange mail account (this one's from work) set-up! (google it and you'll understand) Jailbreaking it provides a solution which sadly does not work. And it goes on and on.

* The only objectively bad-enough point of the Nexus S I've seen is that it has got no miniSD slot. I think that's going to be fine with me, but how useful do you think the miniSD slot would be? Also, what are the main bad points of the Galaxy S that you know?
* Can you develop your own software with the SDK and just have it on your phone? (ie not developing to put it on the market but just copy it over to the phone) I assume this would be possible of course since if the phone is rooted, it would be just a matter of copying files over... but just to be sure there's no authentication/key-signing involved?

I talked to my family, which was an hilarious farce of feigned emotion and scorn.  ""How could you!?""  Really they were just angry with me for making them feel like they had failed, thinking that my worries were faked or something.

Then came the hospitalization.  I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder.  I didn't want to take the medication.  Mania feels so delicious, I didn't think twice about storming out of the psychiatrist's.  At least, not until it was too late.

I got better, I guess.  My life started to turn around.  My interpersonal relationships improved marginally, some folks started to see me as an under-recognized talent.  I thought; ""maybe there's something here for you yet, pal?""

Then reality hit me.

I have never made any effort to plan for my future because I never intended to have one.  I promised myself nothing and I have delivered as ordered.

I have no escape route, no yellow brick road, no safety net, no ejector seat, no sextant on the open seas.  I am lost and hopeless because I have never helped myself - why would I?  I hate the fucker.

57517,"Me: 22 year-old male. Her: ex-girlfriend, dated for ~3 years, my first LTR.

We broke up about 6 months ago, and it wasn't pretty to say the least. Lots of problems brought on by poor communication on both our parts. She felt that life had stagnated and she wanted to have fun while I wanted to ""settle down"" (not the case, but far be it from me to convince her otherwise at the time). We had a pretty ugly fight, the mother of all fights, and that was that. She clearly did want a change of pace as her and her friend packed up and moved to a city 8 hours away from her friends and family. We remained incommunicado for several months (before she left, I feel she played with my heart a little, which made me pretty bitter)

I was a wreck for a while. Went on a bender or four, had some wild nights, and took comfort in my friends. All in all, it was good fun and let me blow off a lot of steam but I'm now settled into a good job, a new apartment, and life on my own. I'm past the stage of looking for random hookups and I'm seeking a more meaningful relationship, but haven't found much luck, leaving me feeling a little lonely and hopeless.

Enter about 3 weeks ago. She IMs me on Facebook to catch up. We talked online for hours. It took me forever to get over this girl, and that conversation reminded me of why I loved her so much. It lit another fire under my heart, leaving me with this odd mixture of longing, confusion, and apprehension. She opened up to me about how hard it's been for her looking for steady work, making friends, etc. I related, yet felt incredibly uncomfortable when she mentioned guys, who just wound up treating her like shit. We talked kinda sporadically, her contacting me each time, and her always wanting to continue the conversation.

On Saturday, I was out in the city with some friends, when I get a series of (clearly drunk) texts from her, the gist of it being that she felt horrible that she threw away our relationship over some things that could have been solved, that I'm the only guy that's ever treated her even halfway decently, and that she's an idiot. Yeah, it was a bit of an ego boost and made me feel a bit better about my own shortcomings that led to the demise of our relationship, but now I'm feeling more conflicted than ever... We spoke about it the next day, and though she was drunk when she wrote it, she meant every word, but was just too proud to admit it to me sooner.

My brain is mush right now. I wanted to move on, but now I feel oddly compelled to roll with this. I still do have feelings for her and this whole ordeal has had me doing a lot of reminiscing. I'm weighing in my head these opposing feelings of ""I'm still in love with her"" and ""she's an ex for a reason"", balanced with my own current feelings of loneliness... and I don't have a solid answer. She says there's a very good chance of her moving back home with her parents in the near future, bringing her back to being 30 minutes away. When we broke up, she was in a phase and I was in a funk. Heads seem to be clearer now, but I'm wondering if it's worth it to pursue rekindling our relationship.

I'm not usually one to come to the hivemind for advice of any sort, but I feel like I need to hear something from someone who's lived it, or can at least look at this objectively. My friends haven't been much help. A lot of them saw us as a ""perfect couple"", and were completely shocked when we broke up. I know a lot of ""forever aloners"" and those longing for lost love, and I know what their advice would be without even asking. My other friends are more of the ""disregard women, acquire currency"" type, and they're not much help either. I also find it hard to ask for advice of this nature to people personally close to me... guess that's why I'm on the internets asking strangers out of a sense of desperation.

I'm honestly not here looking for someone to say what I want to hear, because I have no clue what that is. Just looking for a little guidance from those who have loved and lost more times than I have. Am I just pining for something long-gone?

57855,"Saturday night, I felt ready and vital.

All week I've been day gaming it. I know what confidence feels like. I've been dying to have a go at a party. I read a bunch of seddit and listened to some lectures. I look in the mirror and feel a strong attraction to myself as I finish my 2nd beer.

I'm going to a house party. I'll know 1/2 of the people there somehow. I know this is gonna be easy. I'm excited and confident.

I haven't looked this good in months. I've been doing yoga, broadening my shoulders, improving my posture. I've been growing out my hair, and it's a formidable black curly mane of power. My beard is full, my attire, mature. I am ready. I am vital.

It's cold as fuck outside! I catch a bus by standing with power, asserting with my pecks thrust forward that I need a ride. On the bus, as I round the corner I find an attractive girl making eye contact immediately. I glance away and sit across the aisle and a few seats back. All my preparedness is useless, I am not in state.

I wish the driver a good night and hop off the bus, my hair flying back in the cool breeze. I stop into the local beer distributor for a quart of yuengling and I walk towards the party, singing Peggy Sue. I feel like a man.

I find the house and there's a lone kid smoking on the porch. I bullshit with him, joking about smoking out in the cold. I tell him he's got passion.

I walk in, and down a long empty hall. I open a door and BAM, a room of people I don't know sitting on couches. I don't know what to say so I don't and walk through to the next room. Asian poker face. Not in state.

I felt smacked with relief when I see three good friends of mine and I start talking to them, pissed at myself for making an inconspicuous entrance.  An autistic kid finds me and starts talking enthusiastically and I respond in kind. You gotta be kind.

A train of hot girls burst in through the back door and I exclaim, ""Where the hell did you all come from? Some portal? What the hell is back there?"" It's a stupid question, there's a porch back there, but they laugh. It's not about what you say but how you say it. I turn back to my friends who are laughing and the girls head downstairs where live music is being played. 

I see some more old friends and shoot the shit but I get restless. It's time to head downstairs.

The music is dank. I see people I know all over the place. I greet everybody I know and head to where they are playing beer pong. Except it's strip beer pong and two girls I don't know have their pants and bra off. I quickly decided there was nothing reasonable I could say so I say whats up to the people I know in the room and leave. Gotta display some social proof before leaving.

I open up an HB7 and we have a boring conversation although she was into it. Still not in state, I saw the dance floor and realized the music was *amazing*. I ran in and started dancing like a crazy person. And then I snapped into state.

I was dancing by myself, totally into the moment, not thinking about dancing with any girls until I saw two HB5's laughing at me so I challenged them to the floor and we had a grand old time. I saw a HB6 I already knew and so I pivoted to her. And then it got kinda moshy next to me so I joined that. All that energy fueled the rest of my night.

So I see black and white stripped dress HB7.5 brunette. Damned cute. She's making eyes with me, close to the floor but not dancing. Of course, I asked her, ""What's wrong with you? Why aren't you dancing?"" I take her hand and whirl her around. I've been dancing for twenty minutes so I'm smooth now. I know to lead her, and so she follows. She tells me her name is Amanda. I tell her mine, hit eject, and join the semi-mosh.

Cut to five minutes later and an AFC is talking to Amanda. I'm sitting with a great buddy of mine and she makes eye contact. Now, I didn't think about it, I wink and look back to my friend laughing before I could see her reaction. ""I just winked at a girl and now I will never talk to her again because I just gave myself away."" He says, ""That's retarded,"" and I go, ""you're right,"" and walk up to her.

I have a prop I received earlier randomly, a pair of sunglasses. Wordlessly, I put them on her and say, ""Much better."" To the AFC I ask, ""Isn't she awesome?"" pointing to her shades. I leave, feeling like a douchebag. Would hate to be that AFC. Could have thought of something more worthwhile to say.

The rest of the night I'm bouncing around, talking to everyone, having a great time. And then Amanda comes over and we're talking isolated. I should have realized that I had her isolated but I didn't realize, drunk I suppose. And then she starts the job interview. Ugh, I wish I read about the job interview and the dangers of before that night, but I was an idiot and responded in kind and before I knew it I was in a boring, uninspired conversation. Lost all momentum. And worst I found myself lying to her about being in school because I didn't feel like talking about why I dropped out. Gross.

What I shoulda done is stopped the job interview short, pointed it out, and told her that if she wants to seduce me, she's gotta do better. I would then ""teach"" her to initiate kino to make me feel comfortable and you see where that is going. Biggest lesson learned.

All the other girls I was pursuing left during that conversation and I didn't have the heart to ask Amanda's #, knowing the pointless lies had built up upon themselves to the point where I knew the whole venture would be pointless. I left the party by myself.

TL;DR Had a good time, was life of party, but didn't kiss no girls.

Social Proof is king, easy at house parties. Dancing gives you energy builds social proof, confidence, state. Also great way to open and establish kino. Recognize the job interview, isolation. Don't lie.

What about that welfare/unemployment check you collected when times were hard?  But..but..my neighbor got $50 more in food stamps and the government is WRONGING ME, DAMNIT. 

I wonder if those people cheering for Wikileaks, JA, BM, etc. will feel the same way when it's their personal information being fed to the public to ""serve the greater good.""

Do people really feel there should be no repercussions?  That information is 'free' and should be shared with everybody, regardless of the consequences?

Do you really believe that global anarchy and full transparency is the only solution?

I seriously hope not.

58882,"Oh hai! Glad you decided to actually read this. I'm going to get straight to the point. Reading though a lot of the comments on the taxation posts today made me pretty pissed off and depressed. I feel like everyone (republicans and democrats) are ignoring the real problem.

Why isn't anyone asking about what our taxes are being spent on? The obvious answer is the liberal villain Defense Spending. You're absolutely right in 2009 it was $782 billion; it's the largest single expenditure in our government. I wholeheartedly believe we shouldn't be spending that much on defense alone. I also firmly believe that at some point defense spending will be drawn down over the next few years.

None of that is important when compared to the real problem of our entitlement programs. I'm sure you liberals just twitched thinking I'm going to rant about welfare but welfare is nothing compared to Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. In 2009 the federal government spent roughly $1.3 trillion between those three programs. That is 39% of the budget...

Think about that.

The crisis we're facing is simple to explain but incredibly complicated to fix. Those programs are growing faster than our economy because of our aging population. As our people retire the overall tax base shrinks as well. While retirement benefits are taxed the revenue generated is fixed at whatever the current tax rate is. Therefore the net effect is limiting growth in tax revenue.

Retirees are decreasing tax revenue while simultaneously increasing spending. This is horribly broken and is currently a crisis. While it's easy to blame corporations, the wealthy, or whatever other villain your imagination can conjure the real crisis we're facing is simply old people.

So my young liberal friends why aren't you angry about this crisis? Both parties are ignoring it yet know it's the single biggest problem our government faces. The popular meme is that we're taxing the poor to give the rich when in reality we're taxing the young to give to the old.

[Wikipedia breakdown of govt spending in 2009](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_federal_budget)

TL;DR Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid take up 39% of the Federal Budget in 2009 and will continue to grow as the baby boomers retire.

For the uninitiated, Campus Screenings (and they aren't the only site, there's also Gofobo but I've never once gotten one through them) gives you a chance to win passes (you and a +1).  Catch is they overbook so you have to show up early if you want to get in, let alone decent seats.  I would say 2-3 hours before to get good seats. Especially if it's a high profile one like Tron.  So let's all make this an excuse to meet each other.  Also, in case I don't get any tickets hopefully someone will hook a brother up.

63068,"Hey Reddit,

It seems irresponsible and silly to think that this might have an effect on me consider all the times I’ve tried to quit on my own and failed, but here we go.

I’ve been smoking pot for close to five years now, daily for the past three years and /I’m tired of it. I’ve tried to quit but will always wind up buying a little more, telling myself “what’s a couple more days” and I’ll buy a Q or less and smoke that in a few days, not really getting high anymore, just returning to a steady state. I’ve been buying pot in this way for almost four months now, I had hoped that my usage would taper off, since I was buying smaller amount, but if may have actually increased. 

I’ve been suffering due to my addiction as well, I used to be a lot of things that I no longer am. I can no longer claim to be athletic, smart or kind. I can’t run  because of my lungs and I have no special people in my life to show kindness too I’m afraid of the person I’ve become and the person I may be off the drugs. What if I’ve done permanent damage to myself? Why am I waiting for rockbottom to make a change? 

I’ve got a good job that I’m wasting away in, skipping time to smoke pot at home, great friends who I never see because I spend my weekends locked in my apartment smoking pot, I speak to my drug dealer more then my best friends. 

In the next few weeks there is a pretty good chance I’ll lose my job and I can’t tell if I’ve lost my friends as well. 

Have any of you gone through something this like, can you offer advice or some kind words for a fella in need. 




I want to quit
I want to improve
I want to be happy
I want to be loved
I want to give love
I want to know my potential

Things started to get weird when he suggested we play a game called ""House."" This game basically involved him being the mom and my brother (who at the time was 4) and taking turns being the dad and being the son. All sorts of weird sexual exploits came from that. I don't remember a lot of it, and while I don't think there was any penetration I'm not 100% sure. I do remember him showing us pictures of mostly naked girls, telling us they were his girlfriends, then asking us if we wanted a demonstration on what he does to them. 

This lasted an entire summer. He continued to live down the street from us for about 10 years, moving out of his parents place shortly before I did. Last I heard, he's living with a girl who he got engaged to. 

And yes, this has basically eternally fucked my emotional state for all my life. I've recently gone into therapy, which helps, but I'm still confused and baffled by everything that happened to me.

One such friend was Dom, me and Dom have spent the last few seasons in the woods together, sadly however for 3 years Dom never managed to bag himslef a deer. Last year (his fourth year in the field) we decided to go out on the last weekend of the muzzleloader season (mid December here in NY) and see if the deer were moving more now that there were less hunters to harrass them. Upon arival at the far we hunted I told Dom that I thought our best bets were either the apple crates (a stack of old apple crates at the corner of an apple orchard bordered by open hardwoods and a thick hedgerow that was only a 20 minute walk form where we park) or what we called the backpond (a 2 mile walk form where we park). I told him he could have first pick, and that I woulkd take whichever stand he chose not to. He chose the backpond. 

We geared up and came to realize that we had forgotten our two way radios, decided they were not all that important, picked a time to meet back at the van and parted ways.


I was on my stand 20 minutes later, enjoying the crips winter air, and watching the occasional squirrel or bird do what squirrels and birds do. I was on stand for maybe two hours before I heard the report of a firearm in roughly the direction Dom had headed. 

Me and Dom both shoot competitively, and are both well known for not missing. I knew that if that was indeed Dom's rifle I had heard that a deer was surely dead at his feet. I also knew that he would have no idea what to do next (beyond immediately reloading as he waited for the smoke to clear). I got up form my stand and went back to the van, I removed a few layers (dragging a deer is sweaty work) grabbed the sled I kept in the back of the van, and the tools needed to gut a deerr in the field and began the trek back to the backpond. 

I was about two thirds of the way to backpond when I heard a sort of ""fwump"" which actually sounded alot more like Dom's rifle firing a wet load than the initial report had. Now I was a little worried, I didnt want to affect Dom's hunt, if he was still hunting. I devided I would continue in his direction, and ditch the sled a few hundred yards before I reached his area so that I could make a quiter approach.

I did exactly that, and as I reached the point of the hedgerow I was using for cover I spotted my friend, bowed over, rifle slung across his chest looking left and right. It seemed to me he was hunting, but as I was about to turn around and leave him to it he bent down to pick something up and I saw that he was draggin a deer. It turned out that the second shot was in fact his, and was in fact a bit wet. However the delay in firing didnt cost him his deer, it simply turned his heart and lung shot into an instantly fatal headshot (what I call a lucky miss). When he looked up and saw me he was pretty damn happy, his plan was to drag the entire carcass to my stand and ask ""now what?"" I guided him through the process of emptying the animals guts, and we loaded it onto the sled to drag out. He was as happy as I had ever seen him, and I was glad for having shared the experience with him. 

recipe:

Easy Venison Steaks

this one is too easy for words

in a large container combine 1 bottle of dark beer (something more sweet than bitter, I use Saranac Black Forest) and one bottle of yCraft Zesty Italian dressing. Mix well. Allow thawed steaks to marinade in beer/dressing mix overnight. 

Grill on high heat about 3 minutes per side (asssuming about 1/2 inch steaks) and let sit for 3-5 minutes. Venison should not be overcooked, and if a little pink in the center turns you off wild game is probably not for you.

enjoy.

* Julian Assange released the secret cables.
* He has now been arrested.

Only in the fine print is it ever mentioned that he is charged with ""sexual crimes"".

**There is highly likely a deliberate media engineering effort going on to make it look like what Wikileaks is doing is illegal and Julian is being arrested for the leaks**, not for unrelated sex crime charges. This is also why MasterCard, Visa, PayPal, and others are suddenly and publicly dropping Wikileaks because of ""criminal activity"". They're feeding into the same media engineering effort.

I gotta say, the rape charges were brilliant. Even Assange's avid supporters are not gonna go out there and shout ""he's being charged with rape, but Wikileaks is 100% legal"". By not emphasizing Assange's real charges, we're playing right into the hands of the media engineers.

This is the real story, people. True modern memetic engineering in action. This is what we need to work against if we're to support Wikileaks.

Spread the word -- Julian Assange has NOT been arrested for his work on Wikileaks. What he and Wikileaks are doing is completely legal.

66346,"I think I will try to break this up into casual grouping tips and hardcore grouping tips. I understand not everyone is as hardcore into raiding as I might be. (all hardcore tips inherit casual tips)

**Casual:**
&gt;Tank:

&gt;* Always initiate the battles.
&gt;* Know your way around the instance.
&gt;* Be aware of your surroundings. (ex: patrols, spawning mobs, etc)
&gt;
&gt;DPS:

&gt;* Never initiate
&gt;* Attack what the tank attacks
&gt;
&gt;Healers:

&gt;* Heal the tank before DPS (if the tank dies, you’ll most likely wipe)

**Hardcore:**
&gt;Tank:

&gt;* Constantly rotate targets landing at least 1 hit on each target
&gt;* AoE as much as possible
&gt;* Make sure to constantly check health bars, if someone is low make sure to taunt the mob
&gt;* Face mob away from the raid
&gt;* If you notice a mob is CC’d near you, move mob pack away to eliminate chance that CC’d mob will be AoE’d
&gt;* Don’t stand in shit on the ground
&gt;
&gt;DPS:

&gt;* Know your enemy mobs, if you know that a certain mob is specifically dangerous then kill it (which would overwrite the previous 'attack what the tank attacks' tip)
&gt;* Use Crowd Control (CC) on mobs that are farthest away, or fall into the dangerous category
&gt;* Don’t attack CC’d mobs!!!!
&gt;* Don’t stand in shit on the ground
&gt;
&gt;Healers:

&gt;* Keep an eye on debuffs and remove feared effects, diseases, etc
&gt;* Always have HoT’s on DPS that are taking indirect damage (mob AoE)
&gt;* Be healing efficient. If your heal heals for 400 and your target is only missing 200 life, wait until your target is missing 400 so you’re not wasting power.
&gt;* If your heals are HoT, don’t apply the heal again until the HoT is done. Otherwise you’re wasting power.
&gt;* Communicate that you are going to heal a specific party member so that they can conserve potions and other ""o shit spells"" (paraphrased from pri1mu5)
&gt;* Don’t stand in shit on the ground

73057,"Normal for me is depression. I don't remember the last time I wasn't truly depressed (not including my brief reprieve recently). Must have been when I was a kid and didn't know any better.

I've posted here before. More than once. I've posted in the AMA's about how I was going to go across the US to meet the girl I'd been talking to for over two years. No one directly asked me but it didn't work out. While on the ride back home she told me she didn't want to be in any relationship at the moment. Later she asked if we could still be best friends. I thought I could deal with the whole situation at the time but the reality is coming back slowly. No love lasts forever, and I'll probably be alone for the rest of my life.

I'd never thought about suicide before I met her. I also never drank. Not that I drink a lot. But one night I just got pushed over the edge and got myself drunk. And now I think about suicide a lot. Not that I'd do it.... For some reason I have some kind of mental block against it. I'd never do it. And that's another depressing point- there's no way out for me. I can't kill myself, I don't have enough money for food, let alone alcohol or drugs. I have no friends. I have no time to do anything but work. I'm stuck in this existence.

No, I know what reddepression will say, and I don't want to talk to anyone. My parents and I are as distant emotionally as strangers, and I never want to open up to them about any of this. There's no one else to talk to. I desire to talk to therapists even less than my parents, and I couldn't afford them anyway.

Sometimes I feel I see a light, a little bit of happiness here or there. It's maddening because I don't have the means to reach it. Happiness might be completing a new website, but I never reach it because I don't have the attention span or work ethic to finish. I don't have the creativity and my intelligence is waning. I realize all this and the light goes away and life sucks again.

I don't know.... Depression is normal for me. It used to be comforting because it was the thing I remembered. But my trip showed me how to be happy for a few days. I guess I never really knew what I was missing and I was okay with it. Now I know. I did things on that trip that I want to do again but know I never will. I know what I'm missing now and that just makes my life worse.

TL;DR - I lead a worthless, depressed life, understanding the happiness I miss out on. The love of my life doesn't want a relationship with me, but wants to be friends. I have no way out.",-1,-1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Anywho, we play on a regular basis with some of our friends, the only problem is that they all play really overpowered foolish decks that at the moment has me and the bf saying ""We can't play until we get something better."" In fact, we're pretty tired of losing. It's come to the point that I will hold off on attacking or using any of my cards like Pillory of the Sleepless or Oblivion Ring, because I will automatically become the biggest target on the board, regardless of how many others on the board are bigger threats. So, I guess I just need some help sprucing up my regular playing deck because I don't have enough knowledge of the cards (and access to a rather small amount of cards) myself. I've tried to look for other cards that will help, but it seems that I just can't turn it into a working deck with amazing abilities. 

So i'm posting my deck in the hopes that someone will be kind enough to give me a couple of pointers or perhaps see a combo in my deck I had never thought of before.

74689,"Little background... I come from an upper middle class family. My parents are pretty tight with money, but then, I guess that's why they have any. A few years ago my grandma, whose memory was failing, moved here (California) from North Carolina. Since then my dad has been visiting her every day, usually two or three times, to check on her, bring her groceries, cook her meals and everything. She's always been pretty dramatic (according to my dad, she ""needs righteous indignation like other people need oxygen"") and occasionally wanders off and gets picked up by the police. But she was never officially declared to be incapable of functioning on her own because my dad did everything for her instead of the state. On Thursday, she disappeared. The police were looking for her, flyers were put up, I think there was even a brief mention of it on the news, but at the end of the day no one could find her. The next day we found out she convinced a friend in North Carolina to buy her a plane ticket and an at-the-door pickup service, something she absolutely could not do on her own. My parents say what her friend did is illegal and my dad is petitioning to have her moved to an elder care home (according to the police, she can't live on her own anymore), which of course means getting a court to declare that she's mentally incapable of maintaining herself. This is all well and good, and I'll admit I was getting sick of hearing about it all the time. Except this morning on the way to school my mom told me that right before she left she changed her will... to give me and both my brothers (one of whom, interestingly, is a half brother on my mom's side) each a house.

Needless to say, I'm pretty surprised. I'm guessing that as soon as she's declared incapable of handling herself the will goes into effect. I figure once she can't control her own finances anymore it just defaults to the will. But it's so morally conflicting. My dad deserves this more than me. But my grandma's Alzheimer's has killed her relationship with him and she wrote him out. He says he's okay with it, but I just can't justify taking something I haven't earned.

He was saying that operation payback was wikileak and that the take down of MasterCard was done by Wikileaks. When a caller lost his phone connection on air he then said (as a joke)that it was wikileak who was attacking them. 

I can't blame Mr. Houde for his comments he is just a host not a reporter. His job is basicly to read what he gets on the news reel and put a humourous spin to it.  I was kind of upset but I let it slide. 

Tonight was my mothers birthday and we had a familly dinner and the main subject of conversation was the wikileak case. Everyone at the table was discusing wikileak as being a terrorist organisation and being the pupatrators of the DDOS attack on Mastercard. I couldn't belive my ears. I asked where everyone got their news to voice such opinions and multiple sources in diffrent medias (radio,tv, newspaper) where sited.

Gym class, capture the flag, I could pitch somehow, so I was on the baseball team, but I was definitely the guy who couldn't finish things. I was  probably 20, 30 pounds overweight, so I was pretty embarrassed and spent most of my time trying to avoid ""haha, look at the slow fatty"" jokes.

This gave me a weird attitude about exercise because my whole life I'd been trying to pretend workouts were easier than they were. I did every drill in the easiest way possible to exert as little effort as possible; People kept telling me to flex my abs as I did things, but no way in hell I was doing that. I held my breath some to seem like I wasn't gasping so much, and I never had any fun. Basically, my goal was to do as little as possible.

But today I realized I'm supposed to do the opposite. I should get every possible muscle involved in everything, suck down as much air as I need, and have some fucking fun. I've been trying to survive each set, to do as little as possible and still be able to tell someone I squatted 150. I need to just do the damn set, trying to wring as much out of it as I can. The point is for it to be hard. I should really be trying to make everything look as hard as possible.

How on earth do you wear dresses, or certain shirts, or anything will a low back? I'm a 36C, and my breasts *don't* stay up on their own. Are these options just closed to me? I definitely can't go braless--it's not a look I'm fond of--but otherwise the straps/claps shows a lot, which just doesn't look good, in my opinion.

[dress 3](http://static0.modcloth.com/productshots/0059/4857/24438-1.jpg) - i'm guessing something like this is just totally out of the question for me.

[dress 4](http://static1.modcloth.com/productshots/0058/6235/24124-2_quicklook.jpg) - the front of this would work with a bra, but the sides and the back? no way.

[dress 5](http://static1.modcloth.com/productshots/0058/4915/23710-2_quicklook.jpg) - this one is great in the back and the front, but the sides/underarms would definitely show a bra.

[shirt 1](http://static1.modcloth.com/productshots/0052/3942/18688-3_quicklook.jpg) - this one is fine around the shoulders and sides, but suddenly in the back there's a great big hole right where the bra will be.

Bras with racerback-style (or generally protean) straps still have backs. I do know about strapless/backless bras, but they don't really work, in my experience?

Her dog ran over to me today without a leash and got my dog(leashed) all excited. Meanwhile, she's talking on her cellphone, while her young son is trying to catch this dog. When she finally gets off the phone, and comes to apologize, I comment that her dog ""really should be on a leash."" She said she's sorry, that she has one *holds it up*, and that she took it off for it to go to the bathroom.

Here's my problem, I've seen her multiple times, the dog is never leashed, she's clearly lying, so I insist that the dog has to be leashed, it's the law. She then goes into intimidation mode, ""YOU DON'T TELL ME WHAT TO DO!""

I reply, ""It's the law, I'm not telling you to do anything."" At this point she attacks me again, ""Well maybe if you got out here more."" I stop her, ""I've lived here a lot longer than you."" (Why should it matter how much I exercise or where I take my dog to do it?)

She's trying to get me upset because she doesn't want to respect a simple and important law. I don't want to have my dog leashed as much as the next guy, but I'm not going to break the law because I think I can.

At this point the confrontation is basically over, and I tell her that it's good she's teaching her son to break the law, while ignoring him at the same time.

81353,"I have only smoked weed a handful of times and have always either not gotten very high and been bored, or gotten extremely stoned and had a frightening experience.  I'm going to give it another try again soon and in honor of that I've decided to share my first experience with getting high:

I came home from work one night and my roommate (I was in a dorm room at the time) and one of his friends were attempting to build a gravity bong out of a two liter bottle of soda.  They asked if I wanted to join in and I enthusiastically agreed, still dying to know what it felt like to be high.  They were unsuccessful in building the gravity bong so we decided to just smoke out of my roommate's bubbler.  Bound and determined to get thoroughly high this time I let go of all my better judgment and took a huge hit every time it was offered to me.  I kept remarking about how the bubbler hit so smooth it was like I was just breathing air.  I must have taken about 10 solid hits over the course of about 10-15 minutes.  I was already feeling the effects and it felt fucking awesome.  My whole body felt great and I had a feeling this was going to be a great night.  That's when i received a text on my cellphone.  It was a text from my roommate that I was receiving approximately half an hour after he had sent it.  This, to me, was the most hilarious thing I had ever experienced and I physically could not stop laughing.  My roommate and his friend joined in with great amusement, wondering how I could find something so mundane hilarious.  That's when my journey really began...

All of a sudden feeling very self-conscious about my laughter I ordered my roommate and his friend to stop laughing at me.  This was very difficult to do given the fact that I still could not physically control my own laughter.  Once I got my own laughter under control they started playing Super Smash Bros.  I enjoyed watching them play for maybe 30 seconds before the colors made me feel like I was going to vomit.  I asked if they could please turn off the TV for a little bit while I adjusted to the feelings of being high.  They agreed and in the meantime the room began to close in on me.  I am extremely claustrophobic so this feeling resulted in me just sitting on my bed hugging myself tightly, anticipating my inevitable demise -- being crushed to death by the walls of my own bedroom.  I began to experience chills and I felt like every hair on my entire body was standing on end.  At this point my roommate advised me that it would be a good idea for me to just try to sleep it off.  So we turned out the lights.  My roommate and his friend started surfing the internet on his computer while I tried to sleep.  After what seemed like a very long while I must have been on the verge of falling asleep.  At this point I got the sensation that I was laying in a hospital bed in a coma.  I then heard the sound of my heart flatlining on the heart monitor (I assume it must have actually been intense ringing in my ears).  As a result I became extremely convinced that I had just witnessed my own death.  I immediately got out of bed and started yelling ""I'm going to pass out!  Call for help!""  Don't ask why I said that, it just seemed like a good idea at the time.  My roommate turned on the light and I all of a sudden had the sensation that I woke up from a dream.  I hollered out ""It's okay I'm awake now!""  I didn't immediately remember any of the preceding events of the night, so when they came back to me I realized that I had not woken up.  I had been awake the whole time.  This really freaked me out because I had been so sure just moments ago that I woke up from a bad dream -- but it turned out that that bad dream was reality.

Following this unfortunate event, the three of us sat on the floor of the room and discussed what it was like to be high; we related our current experiences and they shared with me their first experiences.  All the while I was trying to deal with multiple new sensations.  I felt as though my entire body was shaking uncontrollably and there was nothing I could do to stop it.  I felt like my vision had been enhanced so that I was seeing everything magnified (I felt like I could see very clearly every single pore on my roommate's friend's face).  I also had the sensation that the entire room spinning around us and I kept moving my head from side to side to try to counteract the resulting dizziness.  I also had to be constantly touching somebody for reassurance that I was still existing in this world.  If I was not touching anybody then I began to lose the sense of touch over my entire body.  In fact, if I closed my eyes and I was not touching anybody then I felt as though I was somersaulting backwards through infinite space, all alone in my own void.  If I kept my eyes closed then the somersaulting would speed up and begin to become erratic, making me very motion sick.  As I was beginning to get these new feelings under control I all of a sudden got an extreme headrush which prompted me to stand up very quickly.  This gave me the sensation that I woke up yet again and, once more, I hollered ""I'm awake!  I'm awake!""  I then immediately realized that I had been awake the entire time and my initial, frightened response was ""Oh God, I'm the man with the 30 second memory!"" (Google it if you don't know who that is).  This theory was quickly discredited when I realized that I remembered the entire night.  I then continued to struggle with all of the ridiculous feelings I had been experiencing all night until I had eventually come down enough to enjoy it (about 4 hours after I had taken the 10 hits).  I had the sensation of waking up from a dream approximately 15 times over the course of the night, but after a while it just became amusing.  So, basically, I endured 4 hours of a terrifying experience to enjoy my high for about an hour.  The second time I got stoned led to another terrifying, but very different experience.  This time...I will not smoke so much.

My mother taught me how

Lots of games to play

Virtual fields to plow

.

I hear my modem's ringing notes

I'm getting ready to surf the net

My mouse is my surfboard among the boats

I hope I don't get wet

.

I found a forum to post my thoughts

I shared some secrets and a myspace link

Hoped these strangers would connect the dots

Request my friendship, and send me a wink

.


But these kids weren't looking for a friend

Just cruising the internet city streets

Like a gang of criminals ready to send

to hell the first person that they meet

My stories and pictures were met with contempt

Inside me a tree of sadness began to grow

They knocked down everything I began to attempt

With such words as ""Cool story bro"" 

.

Now the waves of the internet sea

Come crashing down on top of me

My sand castle on the beach of the web

Was crushed by the very flow and the ebb 

I cried on every website, every guestbook I could find

I shared my emotions very neatly outlined

Wrote 4 poems about suicide by fire

People don't like them, they say I'm a liar

Let me get back on my surfboard and get out of here...

.

Today I quit the internet

I had no place to hide

Mom won't let me on the internet

It's like a roller coaster kids shouldn't ride

83435,"This is Mel Kiper's Big Board, December 8th edition. I've posted it here because it requires being an ESPN insider to see it.

Note: This is not a mock draft. It only includes 25 players and doesn't guess which team will choose which player. Rather, it tries to rank the top 25 players by their draft eligibility.

* = Junior or draft eligible sophomore.

 1) Andrew Luck * QB -- Analysis: Now completing 70.2 percent of passes in pro-style offense. Arm, smarts and intelligence are all there. Gift-wrapped QB pick. Last week: No. 1

 2) Da'Quan Bowers * DE -- Analysis: His 24 TFL are second nationally. A tremendous physical talent who has shown steady relentlessness this year. Ideal size for 4-3 DE. Last week: No. 2

 3) A.J. Green * WR -- Analysis: Green has been mostly unstoppable even with young QB. Not sure people realize what kind of route-runner he's become. Last week: No. 3

 4) Patrick Peterson * CB -- Analysis: More than freak athlete, Peterson has continued to improve his technical cover skills. Has quietly become among nation's top return threats. Last week: No. 4

 5) Prince Amukamara CB -- Analysis: I'd be more concerned about Amukamara's zero interceptions in 2010 if any quarterback was willing to challenge him. A gifted technician. Last week: No. 5

 6) Nick Fairley * DT -- Analysis: Brilliant season from Fairley. He's dominated even while not 100 percent at times. He simply epitomizes the ideal penetrating 4-3 DT. Last week: No. 6

 7) Ryan Mallett * QB -- Analysis: Mallett has become far more than a big arm. Patience, poise and willingness to check down have enhanced his stock. Last week: No. 9

 8) Cameron Newton QB -- Analysis: Once more, Newton got to show that he's more than a mere running threat. Capable of extending plays to use his big arm. Last week: No. 14

 9) Julio Jones * WR -- Analysis: Jones had a stellar junior season; when healthy, he was impossible to stop; when not, he was still good. Greater ability to separate in 2010. Last week: No. 10

10) Marcell Dareus * DE -- Analysis: Played well early against Auburn in his last game, but looked worn with the rest of Bama's defense late. Best suited as 4-3 DT at the NFL level. Last week: No. 8

11) Robert Quinn * DE -- Analysis: Freakish athlete with decent size, great quickness and pass-rush skills. Ineligible all year, but scouts are captivated by his talent. Last week: No. 7

12) Ryan Kerrigan DE -- Analysis: Led country with 26 TFL, he became simply impossible to block, even against double-teams. He's ideal for 3-4 OLB, possible 4-3 DE. Last week: No. 12

13) Von Miller LB -- Analysis: Miller has shown recently that his ability to drop and cover has grown. Good 3-4 pass-rusher, with great edge quickness; sack machine. Last week: No. 15

14) Justin Blackmon * WR -- Analysis: Wrapping up a breakout season, he has been impossible to keep covered. Good size and speed combo with ability to set up DBs. Last week: No. 13

15) Akeem Ayers * OLB -- Analysis: His exceptional athleticism makes him so versatile. Ideal every-down 3-4 OLB who can rush and cover. Ayers should test well in Indy. Last week. No. 12

16) Drake Nevis DT -- Analysis: Explosive, up-the-field tackle. Ideal three-technique who plays with great leverage and passion. Solid against run and pass. Last week: No. 16

17) Nate Solder OT -- Analysis: Physical freak with improved skills. Should dominate in workout phase and could get bump in draft short on elite OTs. Last week: No. 17

18) Anthony Castonzo OT -- Analysis: Smart, reliable, solid footwork but could add lower-body strength to become better leverage player. Back up after rough stretch. Last week: No. 18

19) Adrian Clayborn DE -- Analysis: Sacks were down but increased attention was part of that. A guy who batters offensive linemen; has great motor. Last week: No. 20

20) Derek Sherrod OT -- Analysis: A later entry to the Big Board this year. An athlete at OT, ha moves his feet well and has been steady against good players; continues to improve. Last week: No. 21

21) Gabe Carimi OT -- Analysis: Has had fantastic fall, battling a number of likely high draft picks to standstill. Once beaten by speed too often, his footwork has improved. Last week: No. 22

22) Mark Ingram * RB -- Analysis: Average per rush now tick below last year, but explosive and physical after being dinged early. Solid finisher but top-end speed is in question. Last week: No. 19

23) Jake Locker QB -- Analysis: Skill set is fantastic, but poor year overall. Has done a great deal of his best work versus bad competition. Last week: No. 23

24) Rahim Moore S -- Analysis: Production down this year after breakout 2009 season, but QBs also stayed away. Good instincts, and he gets solid marks as cover safety. Last week: No. 24

25) Jon Baldwin * WR -- Analysis: Great physical skills and size. Baldwin has had a rocky season -- games with 1, 3, 2, 3 catches -- but QB issues were part of that. Last week: No. 25

84155,"I love BC2 as much as the next guy, but I'd have to say, I'm not a fan.
(Obligatory disclaimer: yes its great they have us to it for free etc etc)
If you take out the 'herp derp new maps I was so bored of the other ones' factor and look at the maps objectively, I'm not sure they're comparatively as good as the originals that came with the game.

I never thought I'd say this, but I actually think they're too big.  If BC2 was 64 player, we'd have no problems at all, but as of right now a few of them are so spread out you spend half the game travelling, which doth not a fun game make.

**Cold War**
So narrow and medic infested that most of the games I've played have simply been 16 medics mowing each other down in a hallway (one of three hallways actually- left flank, right flank, down the middle).  The snow glare/wind makes killing people so hit and miss there is nothing tactical whatsoever about the map.  If I wanted an arena shooter I'd go play COD.

**Oasis**  Probably the best of the new maps on conquest.  On rush it is so ridiculously unbalanced in favor of the defenders its not even funny.  A _barely_ competent defending side can hold the first or second set of bases with ease.  Boring as shit on defense and rage inducing on attack.

**Harvest Day** is okay at best.  holding points on conquest is a bit of a crap shoot.  There's pretty much no solid cover, or anywhere to hide, meaning that staying alive is luck of the draw.  This should normally be balanced out by the fact there is little cover for an attacker, but with only 16 a side, covering four bases with 360 degrees of possible attack avenues using BC2's broken ass/unused voice comms makes it a difficult job.  And not a difficult job as in a challenge, I mean a difficult job as in frustrating and not fun.  Admittedly, I haven't played a rush game of harvest end to end yet, so can't comment there.

**Heavy Metal** isn't bad, but again, with only 16 players a side, engagements are short and traveling times are long.  The massive bias against helicopters (engi's with tracers, AT4's, tank turrets, tank alt weapons, mounted MG's, Vads, AA-Guns) coupled with the post-patch 'helicopters fly like shopping trolleys' physics make staying in the air more luck than skill.

So yeah, again, I'm not moaning that we're getting content for free- its great of dice/ea to do that when they probably could have got away with making it paid-for DLC, so I really appreciate that they're doing that for us, but in comparison to the perfectly sized and (for the most part) pretty well balanced original maps (think Port Valdez and Arica Harbour for example), I don't really rate them.

Right now I'm looking to add about 15 lbs and have adjusted my diet accordingly. I also just started taking creatine (ON brand). According to the directions I need to load (4 doses a day) for the first 4-5 days, so I started yesterday and I've noticed 2 things that I am not sure are related, but I've not made other changes so I'm guessing they could be.

1. I didn't sleep *at all* last night. As if I had caffeine but without the jitters or stomach butterflies (I don't do caffeine). My mind was just racing. I'm already a poor sleeper and last night was the worst. I'm wondering if it is just my body adapting to my new energy level from the creatine and this effect will subside eventually.

2. Erections. Yeah, I seem to be popping up a lot. Not necessarily a bad thing but, at my age, I wasn't seeing quite as much as when I was a kid. Just curious if it could be the creatine or am I getting my second wind.

87282,"I don't know where I stand on the political spectrum.

- **I believe the mentally ill and mentally retarded should be institutionalized.** Mostly the ones that need constant care and cant even figure out their are alive.

It is a sad fact that there are people collecting loads in disability for their adult relatives with retardation like down-syndrome where they can not be functional in society. Also, many mentally ill people on the governments dime getting thousands and thousands in medication and they are still hardly functional and need almost constant care. I'm not saying everyone who falls below an IQ of 70 cannot function. My ex is retarded, but good enough to have a drivers license and be a very productive hard laborer. He can function will little help from others. Im talking about people who sit around and drool all day and squeal. Centralizing their care in institutions may be cheaper. Im also not saying just because someone has depression that they are a waste. No, I'm talking more about insane people. If the family wants them, the family gets them. But no government aid. Its a waste.

- **Retirement age should be based on your career or how badly your body is aged.**

My father, hes never been to bright, ill admit, the man dropped out of school in 7th grade when he was 16. But he now is a very well known and valuable asset to the company he works for. He is a propane delivery truck driver. He is an excellent driver and by some miracle he passes his written tests every 3 years (there's so much junk about other substances he never transports its insane). His body, as determined by doctors is worn right away. He has not a strip of cartilage left in his shoulders or knees from working so hard his whole life, and he is only 58. Doctors push him to quit and try to get disability before he kills himself, but he, or me, doesn't know how he will be able to eat or pay bills for the 1 to 2 years it will be before he starts seeing a check *if* he can get approved. Then there is people like my grandma (rest her soul) she was in great shape. Healthy as an ox into her 80's she was sharp as a tack and cleaned houses for extra money. I'm not saying that she shouldn't have been able to retire briefcase she was healthy, but she defiantly would have had no physical or mental issues holding one down right on into her 70s. She worked until her very last years. I'm just saying 65 is a death sentence for some people.

- **affordable health insurance for all is good.** So long as it helps you get back to work.

As a sick person myself I think it is good for everyone to have the opportunity for good health. I was stricken with some type of illness that the doctors could not figure out what it was before I was so sick and could not work I got fired. Still sick. I need one operation to determine the problem and when they do, more than likely a little treatment and boom! I'm back to work. If not? Oh well, Im screwed. But im not gonna sit on my ass collecting something I never worked for. Im young and sick. Not old and worked 35, 40 years and then sick. I don't deserve it. I hate sitting here doing nothing all day. Not to mention relying of friends that know how sick I am and throw me some money for bills so I'm not homeless again. Young people like me who are sick and will always be sickly? Goes back the the first thing kinda, institutionalize the hopeless ones. I am not a hopeless case. Even If I never get the operation I need I can still work, just not on a schedule. I fix peoples computers for extra money too. I can do that. If I start getting in pain I stop and go lay down for a few hours. A job? The nail in my coffin is always telling them ""hey, i get violently ill sometimes, and when I do its sudden and everything stops right there."" and they point me out the door. I am not ""reliable"" in my condition in any way. But I can still do small things to be productive, like many in my case. Temporary insurance for the sick is a good thing. Once they are determined to be better and have no problems, cut them right off. Go work for insurance. The insurance should not have a ridiculously high deductible too. I knew what procedure I needed in my final month of working but the deducible was $2,000. WAY out of my reach. Hospitals would not take a payment plan citing that people who have such high deductible usually don't pay.

Rarely stepping out of the comfortable realm of that oh so familiar firearm angled out of the corner of the screen. I have these two ideas that I think should be, in some way, integrated into the FPS genre. 

""Glance-Back"": Are you ever walking down a valley when out of no where you are knifed by an op-for. My reaction is usually: ""I knew I should have been checking my back more"". My proposed solution would be designating a button (or multiple buttons in unison) to a quick look over the shoulder. FOV was only about 3/4 of what you would normally see (look over your shoulder right now to get an idea of what i mean) it would be a great advantage when moving through enemy territory. This is already available when using most vehicles withing games such as Battlefield: Bad Company 2, which in my opinion isn't plausible at all. When was the last time you got out of your vehicle and climbed onto the hood to see how many Apaches were chasing you?

Dive: Once again strolling through an enemy village you find that shots  have been fired on you and decide that a quick strafe left or right will save you. No, you are dead, that was a dream. Actions like diving or rolling are common in many third-person games. Your avatar has the ability to dive quickly to the left or right to avoid oncoming demons, ogres, frag grenades, or the ever so familiar bullet fire. Yet we don't have this ability in FPS games. Once again I propose that developers work in a dive option. At first this may sound like a huge advantage for the person being fired on, allowing them to quickly dive behind cover and shoot you in the face. However, if implemented properly the attackee would only have a split second to react in this manner and put them out of danger for a split second. So if you are walking at your enemy and laying down fire then they will more than likely not have time to react. If you hare burst firing from mid - long range than it may give the attacked time to move outta the way, regain health and continue their stroll.

93332,"I had two different groups today for Stonecore.

The first was great.  After the first couple pulls, I told them it would probably be necessary for me to drink pretty often.  The tank said np, and actually reminded me to drink a couple of times.  Healing now is pretty strained now as it usually is when making the necessary gear jump, and the first group understood pretty well.  We finished with a couple of minor hiccups.

The second was terrible.  We wiped on the first pull, then I got bitched out for not healing.  The next few pulls the group just ran around like its heroic UK or something.  I was draining mana and poppings CDs on every pull.  We wiped on the first boss and I get bitched out again.  

Although not usually as bad, groups like the latter are more frequent.

The basic tactic in the game has been lost on a generation of players I think.  The tank is literally the only member who is supposed to get hit (other than incidental damage).  Adherence to this tactic was once critical and is becoming that way again.  When shit got easier, healers healed the group, cause what the hell why not.  Now, it seems, that the group *relies* on group heals.

Exacerbating the problem is that there is no benchmark for a decent healer.  People judge the quality of healing as whether they die or not.  No one (usually) goes into a fight thinking, ""hmmm, the healer should hit about XXXXXXXX HP healed this fight.  Moreover, since there is only one healer in 5s, there is no one to measure up against.

Back in the day the healer would have some power in a group.  DPS would apologize for pulling, tanks would apologize for not picking up an add and what not.  These days, it seems that if someone dies, it was the healers fault.

I know most people who play now, did not spend months getting to 60 when every instance relied on the tactic outlined above.  And the expansion is new so people are getting used the increased difficulty.  But, contrary to popular opinion, its not always the healers fault.


OK I feel better now :)

** Edit **

Thanks for the support dudes (and possibly ladies)!  I should note that I do enjoy the challenge now, healers should eventually run out of mana.  Also, all my tools are finally being utilized, which I like.  The game is much more interesting now.  Also questing is super fun too.

My problem is just that people tend to blame healers, no more than ever, for their own lack of skill.  And if I do my job too well they will never get it.

94204,"Hi /r/LGBT. I am developing an idea for a painting that strongly speaks on my sexuality, religious bigots, and some LGBT people (not the whole community). Here are some sketches of it:

http://i.imgur.com/783Zg.jpg

http://i.imgur.com/zysKB.jpg

http://i.imgur.com/8Q6iK.jpg

 The painting is for my Art 20 IB course, though it is not an actual assignment since this course is very lenient about independent work (basically I can do whatever I want as long as I’m actually learning).
*****
Here is an explanation of the symbols used:

**Center person:** Me.

**Girl and guy:** Other bisexuals. My attraction to both men and women. Strength. Comfort in the thought that there are others like me.

**Walking forward/away from crowds:** Not ignoring them, but rejecting their beliefs and not letting them “get to you”

**Left crowd:** LGBT who are non-supportive of bisexuals

**Burning flag:** misrepresentation of LGBT values

**Right crowd:** non-allied and religious community who are non-supportive of bisexuals.

**Burning cross:** misrepresentation of values taught by Jesus (“love everyone”). Using religion as a scapegoat for discrimination and hate.

**Clouds:** My agnosticism. How people try to force their religion on others when they have no proof of anything. How we must take accountability for our own actions without saying they’re from God because we can’t know if there is one or what that God would be like.

**Light (from the bottom):** A better future. Acceptance from self and from others.
*****
So basically it is a coming out story, social commentary, and hope for a better future all wrapped into one.

95041,"I've noticed a recent trend in my conservative suburban hometown: trendy urban looking people parading around. It's even more noticeable amongst the females who seem to have an eye for me.

I've chatted with a few members of this new breed of people that I hadn't seen in my area very much until recently. They almost always seem to lack the ability to hold a meaningful conversation and just blurt out the most random shit to make them seem like they're in some non existent ""in"" crowd. One example of this happened today.

I had bummed a cigarette from one girl while I was on my break at work and I noticed this particular brand of smokes were quite a bit shorter than most cigarettes. I quickly remembered a former boss I had who smoked something similar, 72s, so I asked the girl if that's what they were just to start some friendly small talk. However, her response wasn't the expected, ""Yeah, I prefer smoking smaller amounts at a time,"" or something else a bit more logical, Instead it was, ""Yeah, they're cheap, I feel like I should light up two at a time though."" At this point I looked at her, smiled, and raised an eyebrow all the while wondering if she was being intentionally ironic or if she was genuinely stupid. As the conversation began to lull, I started getting distracted by some construction happening nearby. I decided to keep the conversation going, because there's nothing more painful that awkward silence. I pointed over to the work being done and inquired what they were doing. She then paused and said one of the most non sequitur and retarded things I have ever heard, ""I like to buy my clothes at resell shops."" Now this statement by itself isn't all that stupid, I'd even agree with it, as I like to shop at thrift stores as well. However, at this point I realized the girl must have caught on to my Ray Ban frames (prescription), skinny jeans, worn out thrift store jacket, androgynous haircut and graphic tee. On this current day, it was very obvious, my hipster was showing and this girl was trying to impress me with her ""cred"". She then began to go onto a spiel about how she doesn't like spending very much money, how she usually makes her own clothes, and how The Clash is one of the most inspiring bands of all time. I quickly find out I'm very similar to this girl in many ways. We're both frugal with our money, we both like being crafty in ways to help us save more, and we like old school punk rock (clearly her more than me.) However none of this seemed to matter. The fact that this girl, instead of keeping the conversation light as I enjoyed the mooched cigarette I received from her, had to go ahead and practically say ""Hey, look at me, I'm hip too!"" To top it all off, as I was leaving I decided it would be polite to ask this girl her name. She told me hers, I told her mine, and them her final words to me were, ""What's your sign?"" I answered and walked away only to think ""What the fuck? My sign?""

96408,"**I'm putting this up concerning an incident a friend went through recently.**

""...At 3:30, I pick up my mail and note that I have a package waiting at security. This is standard operating procedures for my condo. Security signs for packages. I actually had 3 packages. One package consisted of two CZ858s rifles (one restricted, one non-restricted) and two individual crates of 7.62x39. Although the CZs were discretely packaged, the ammo was not.

When I pick up the packages, the security officer (an older gentleman - perhaps in his 50's) said, ""Oh, your the one with the rifles and ammo"". I didn't really respond to this. He then stated, ""Well, I hope you don't plan on keeping this stuff here"". I responded, ""Why not""? His answer, ""I DON'T WANT TO SEE ANYBODY GET SHOT"". I attempted to reassure him that I would be the last person to worry about going on a rampage.

I then took all my packages up to my condo (encountered absolutely nobody along the way), opened up the rifle boxes, cleaned them, trigger locked the non-restricted and properly secured the restricted. I then broke down the cardboard boxes (which only said ""CZ"" on them as well as had a little sticker which said ""858-2"" and ""858-4"". I also removed any identifying names (mine) from the packages and placed them in the recycling bin.

Skip forward to 9:10pm. My wife returns from her Pilates class and finds several uniformed police officers gathered in the elevator area on my floor. They ask her where she is going and when she tells them, they frantically call their superiors and state ""We have the wife right here"". They ask her whether I'm home and she tells them that she isn't 100% certain. Guessing that it is something firearms related, and knowing what kind of fishing expeditions happen with inspections, she refuses multiple requests to enter with her, and she also refuses to leave the door open. She then tells me what she encountered and then I wait. For approximately 20 minutes, nothing happens. I am able to note 4 marked police cruisers and one unmarked are waiting downstairs (isn't technology wonderful). I then see an officer with the rifle boxes place them in the trunk of one of the cruisers. Figuring they weren't going away, and knowing I did nothing wrong, and wanting to get some sleep, I call 22 division and tell them that I wanted somebody from the crew down there to call me.

About two minutes later, I do receive the call. Basically the sergeant tells me that they received a call and found my two boxes. He tells me that her knows that I am a legal firearms owner and that he has checked the system and sees that the non-restricted CZ is registered to me, but that the restricted is not. He says that he wants to come and inspect the firearm, the certificate and the storage. When I asked him whether they had a warrant, he responded that they DID NOT. I told the sergeant that I do have a certificate and that he should be calling the CFC which would certainly be able to prove it's worth the billions of dollars we have poured into it. He again explains that it isn't in the system and that he needs to come and check. I then ask him, ""What law do you think I have violated"", to which he responds, ""That's what we are trying to determine"". I end the conversation with ""I'm sorry, without a warrant, you will not be entering my suite, and I will not help you with your fishing expedition"". At this point, I believe that the sergeant lost cell phone reception (happens often on the ground floor) since the conversation ended mid sentence.

I then get my notice of transfer out to get the registration certificate number and wait for a call back. After about five minutes of no call, I contact 22 division again and ask that the sergeant call me back so I can forward him my certificate number and end this fiasco of wasted time and resources. A couple of minutes later, I get the know at the door. From this point, here's the conversation as I remember it (Me = Me, Him = Detective Constable with the Guns and Gang Squad)

KNOCK KNOCK
Me: Who is it?
Him: Toronto Police

Me: OK
Pause...

Him: Can you open the door?
Me: I'm sorry, it's late, I'm not feeling well, and I'm not decent.

Him: Can you go throw some clothes on so you can open the door?
Me: It's my house and I elect not to.

Him: It's kind of awkward speaking through the door.
Me: Sorry, but if you want to speak with me, it will have to be this way.

At this point, he goes over the same story that the sergeant did over the phone about the restricted rifle not being in the system and that he wanted to enter to check it's legitimacy.

Me: Why don't you call the CFC?
Him: Well, our computers say it's not on there.

Me: Call the CFC. They exist for reasons just like this.
Him: Well why don't you open up. We can just check.

Me: Do you have a warrant?
Him: No.

Me: Without a warrant, you WILL NOT be entering.
Him: If you have nothing to hide, you should have no problem with us coming to check.

Me: Because I have nothing to hide is exactly why you have no reason to come inside.
Pause

Him: Listen, we have a report dealing with firearms. We're not just going to go away.
Me: That's great, but I'm not opening my door. I have broken no laws. I have done nothing wrong.

Him: Just open the door and show us your certificate, and this will all be over.
Me: I'm not opening the door, but I'd like to help you, so why don't I just read you the certificate number and you can call the CFC and they'll confirm everything is OK.

This little bit of the conversation repeats over and over again. The officer does not want to accept the number, insisting on physically checking the paperwork and storage.

Him: I'm going to note in my report that you are being uncooperative. This won't fare well for you.
Me: I am attempting to assist you, but you are insisting on violating my Charter Rights and illegally entering.

Him: Which Charter Right is that?
Me: Section 6 (I have learned this little misinformation trick from the Police themselves in the past. It is a fine way of testing their knowledge of the situation).

Pause...
Pause... They don't realize that section 6 doesn't apply, because their knowledge of the Charter is limited. Rookie mistake.

Him: So are you telling me that you are not going to cooperate.
Me: I'm attempting to help you out by giving you the certificate number, which is as good as the certificate itself, but you won't take it.

Him: When my report goes to the CFO and shows you aren't cooperating, it will affect your ability to renew you license.
Me: How about I scan a copy of my certificate and email it to your division.

Him: We're not equipped to deal with that. (Are they really so cash strapped that they have no email)
Me: Well then I can't help you.

Him: I know you have the firearm, I need to see the certificate.
Me: I have the certificate, everything is legitimate.

Him: So you admit you have the rifle.
Me: I'm not answering any more of your questions. Without a warrant, you are not entering. I've tried to assist you, but you won't listen.

Him: Good night.
Me: Good night.

This ended the events for the night. 

The next day, I contacted the CFOs office and requested that they confirm that the registration certificate was indeed on the system. Not only was it there, it was the first firearm that comes up. I explained the story and she was sympathetic and confirmed that I acted well within my rights and that the officer should have had access to the information from his computer. I told her my concerns about the officers threats that there would be license renewal problems and she reassured me that she would take it up with the boss and make sure that it didn't happen.

Immediately following this conversation, I contacted the Guns and Gangs task force. A representative told me the following:

Currently, the Task Force has engaged in a large scale operation involving the expired PALs of Toronto as well as unregistered firearms. I was not on any such list. She also confirmed that my restricted CZ was on the computer system, but that the CPIC version may not have been updated (Note: The firearms was entered on the system on the 13th, and the incident occurred on the 19th. Can such discrepancies really exist?). She stated that there is no criminal investigation involving me, and that I have appeared to be complying with all regulations. There will be no escalation of this issue to the CFO and I have nothing to worry about.""

I know that there are thread currently about searches and speaking with police. The above could fit nicely in either spot. Legal gun owners should know that they can stand up for their rights without fear. I stood up to the task force specifically attempting to confiscate firearms, and survived. They can too. I've preached it several times in those threads, and it holds true:

NO WARRANT, NO ENTRY!!!

96570,"I don't usually get miffed about idiots boiling down a bit of anal retentiveness or a strange but relatively non-disrupted quirk to 'OCD,' but it's when [shit like this](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/eiwrp/i_noticed_something_when_i_broke_reddit/) gets upvoted into oblivion that things start to get on my nerves--an interesting, slightly humorous observation that I would have upvoted were it not for the poster's addendum.

I'd be the first to admit that OCD has its humorous aspects--back when my contamination fears were bad, I learned how to turn off the faucet and open the door with my feet.  I could even manage a door knob with my shoes on.

Now--quirks could very well be OCD, but it trivializes the disease and makes light of how severe it can actually be.

Ask me almost anything.  I've experienced crippling contamination fears and even worse intrusive thoughts, but, fortunately, special therapy and hard work has allowed me to learn how to cope with the OCD and live relatively symptom free.

To preface any questions--contamination fears are more common with OCD and more 'acceptable,' meaning you can approach many 'regular' therapists about them.  Intrusive thoughts, on the other hand, are the kind of OCD symptom that can often go undiagnosed because the victim is afraid of telling, or misdiagnosed because some doctor didn't recognize the disease.

'Intrusive thoughts' are best described [in this article by my therapist](http://www.behaviortherapycenter.com/BehaviorTherapyCenter/Tormenting_Thoughts.html) -- thoughts are unwanted and usually of a violent and/or sexual nature.  If anyone has OCD in the DC metropolitan area, I suggest looking her up--without her, I would not have managed.",-1,-1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I'm not ignoring that they exist (and are in most cases fixable with some terminal magic), but the benefits outweigh the problems. It's open, free as in speech, easy to tinker with, has fairly good pure 64bit support, package managers, community, not monopolizing the desktop market, not selling antennas that don't work properly, things like that.

Here's some background information: Sometimes my Grandfather will say/do things that are irritating or dumb, but my family just shrugs them off because we think he just gets easily confused or just doesn't pay much attention to things. My Mother came up with the idea that he can't possibly be that confused and that he is really doing these things as pranks.


Here's the story:

Several years ago my family was at a restaurant. When we started to order, my Grandfather asked the waitress for poon tang (he was trying to order poutine). The waitress became red faced and asked him to clarify. He proceeded to act confused and order poon tang again. At this point my Father lost it and started laughing and my Grandmother clarified his order to the waitress. We all just assumed that he had no clue how to pronounce poutine and didn't know what poon tang was.



A little bit ago my Grandfather was talking to me and says, ""Remember when I asked that waitress for poon tang instead of poutine? The look on her face was great."" He knew what poon tang was and how to pronounce poutine. He managed to troll my family and some random waitress, and got away with it.


EDIT: Corrected spelling of 'poon tang', thanks SourCreamWater.

Fewer qualified people are enlisting forcing lowered standards for a job that rightfully should be for the ""best and brightest"". Recruiters are increasingly targeting disadvantaged minorities and young people from economically distressed areas. Incentive for service is no longer about idealism and become more out of socioeconomic necessity. I don't see any end to this madness until a cross section of our society is faced with a draft. Only then will we change our course. I believe these legislative acts only perpetuate a problem that eclipses both immigration reform and gay rights.

As for the repeal on ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell"", I completely and whole heartedly agree that men and women should have equal rights regardless of their sexual orientation and this would, of course, include military service. But, the motivation seems so suspect. When Joe Leiberman is behind it the bill has to be suspect.  I know it is a stereotype and can only speak to anecdotes, but every gay man or women I have met aren't the current norm for ""army material"". They are intelligent, compassionate, non-violent, creative, insightful, etc. Through the use of reverse psychology they have convinced an untold number of people that they want to enlist just because they can't. How many will enlist immediately following the repeal just because they can?

It's doable content if you run with 4 other people, on vent, that you're sure are skilled and well read up on the content. If you can't put that together and are counting on the random finder to fill a group for you, you might as well unsubscribe now.

While I think that the Wrath model was far too easy, I think they've gone way to far in the other direction. Hard is good, but making all the content unPuGable isn't.

I don't want to have to find 4 competent friends and get on vent for what should be a 30-45 minute heroic random after work. I don't want to have to join a top tier raiding guild to clear normal mode entry-level content. Color me disappointed.

I feel 'faceroller tears' posts and comments are just a poor troll at a legitimate concern. /2 PuGs for raids? Even on the best realms that won't happen anymore. The heroic dungeon finder is dead in terms of making actual groups. Everything has to go through pre-made groups now, and if you want to raid you're going to be forced back into joining a raiding guild instead of picking up a random PuG in your free time. 

There are a lot of good players that don't have the schedule or resources to put things like this together, and they're going to be shut out, shit-out-of-luck in this xpac, regardless of their skill.

I think I'm a quality player, and in Wrath I exclusively PuG'd through Bane of the Fallen King and the ICC drakes. I PuG because I'm an adult with a career, friends, a full-time GF, and a social life. I want to be able to join a /2 PuG or just hit the random dungeon finder and have a reasonable chance of success. I can't commit to a raiding guild and often don't have the time after work to wait for 4 competent, geared friends to join vent and queue for a random heroic. While I agree the game needed to be made more difficult, this level of difficulty has killed the game for millions of PuGers who are good players, not just facerollers.

100518,"I've always wondered why the capping system was a flat-rate: 150 points per capture. Wouldn't it make more sense to award a variable number of points based on how much one contributed to the cap? For instance, if you sit there from start to finish, 150 points. If you come in when there flag is already half capped, 75 points. To combat the obvious--that point-scores in domination would almost always be lower--they could increase the points for a full flag cap. This would not only create incentive for playing the objectives, but would reduce the occurrences of the following obnoxious scenario:

Very often I will sit on a flag, capping, while my idiot teammate hides behind a box a few feet away, waiting out any possible explosives. Then, when the flag is almost completely capped, he will run around and snag himself 150 points. Very often, though, I will die before he runs over, and the flag will remain uncapped. And in almost all of those instances, we would have successfully capped the flag had he helped me from the beginning.

I am also surprised that there is not a point bonus for capping a flag by oneself. For as long as it takes one to sit on B-flag, out in the open, completely vulnerable to explosives and enemy fire, with no backup from teammates, it seems like you should get more than 150.

Does anyone know whether or not Treyarch has considered this, and what possible reasoning there would be for not implementing such a system?

[Submission on 08RANGOON749](http://www.reddit.com/r/Leakspin/comments/ejjbl/08rangoon749_burmese_civilian_offers_to_sell/) which is about a Burmese civilian attempting to sell Uranium-238 to the embassy.

My point being, there are clearly connections between these cables, and in fact they give context to each other. You'll note in the submission on the sale of uranium to China comment thread that someone wondered why that would even be news. It makes a lot more sense in the context that there's a potential nuclear reactor going up in Burma.

Similarly, I've read a series of cables on Hezbollah, Syria and Israel that should all be submitted together. (I'll provide a summary later, I first want to check to make sure it's not all ready public news, which I suspect it is) 

The point is, if you read a cable, check for similar cables so that they can be submitted together instead of having the whole subreddit get cluttered up with individual cables that don't make sense individually.",-1,-1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
102620,"Dear Reddit,

For a while I've been debating a career in the military as an officer. I know all the pros and cons, I know the dangers firsthand, I know exactly what I would be getting myself into. This is not my problem. My indecision stems instead from knowing the military is likely my best course in life, but not particularly liking the idea of spending twenty years of my life living it.

However, today I learned something new about my dad. He has had a boil on his back for the past five years. It is about the size of a golf ball, and relatively painless. Recently it began to seriously hurt him, and because he doesn't have health insurance (at sixty) or a job (he was laid off recently when the construction industry went belly-up), mom had to score the boil with a knife and use a shop vac to suck all the pus out.

The resulting abscess is at least one knuckle deep.

So, I don't think I'm going to debate things too much longer. Dad followed his heart, and look where it got him.

Started off the evening at friend of mine's place for a little pre-party before the club. I won't spend too much time on this because it kinda sucked. Everyone was really young and not so into speaking English, so I did the most boring thing possible and spent the time catching up on emails and reddit on my phone. My friend was a little annoyed, but she was also being annoying because she was stressing out pointlessly over this girl who wasn't even there. I should have handled it better, but I just wanted to get to the fucking club. Eventually, people finally started getting ready to go. They were going to walk somewhere to pick up this girl (HB10) at her house, but since the club was just around the corner and it was raining, I said I would just go to the club and see them there. 

So, I get to the club and see another friend of mine there who I don't really like, but we go to the same places and are always friendly. She's there with this cute gay boy and I chat and have a few drinks with them. It was pretty fun, but nothing special. They go off dancing, and I start checking out the room. Almost immediately, I run into this really sweet gay guy who is a friend of mine and we get to talking. Then after some minutes the HB10 that the group from the party went to pick up, finds me and comes over to say hi. She might not be a 10 to everyone, but she definitely is to me. She reminds me a lot of a young Jessica Alba. But, she is still a teenager and so it's hands off for me. But, she's hugging me and giving me lots of attention and social proof, so it's all good. I take a little break to introduce the two cute gay boys to each other, which was fun because they hit it off almost immediately and were making out in minutes. Lucky boys. :)

Then the HB10 finds me again and drags me back to dance with the group from the party. I bring her a beer because she's underage and can't go to the bar herself. She's super grateful and sweet about it. I don't normally buy girls drinks, but I'm not pursuing her. So, we hang out and get silly on the dance floor. The HB10 is in fine form tonight and starts making out with this hot blonde chick, and everyone is having a good time. Nothing too eventful happens, just some dancing and goofing off and talking to some random people about random shit.

Finally, I find myself a target... this HB9 with reddish hair. I'd seen her around before and wanted to talk with her. She's smiling at me on the dance floor, so feel like I have an opening. For some reason, I don't remember the details of how it went down, but I got the HB9 to go sit and talk with me. I know my opener wasn't anything fancy at all though. I probably just said ""Hi, I'm XX"". She's asking me questions and makes it pretty easy. When the subject of work comes up, I quickly transition it to ""what are you passionate about"" instead of ""what do you do for a living"". Since mine is writing, she asks me to tell her about one of my screenplays. Normally, I don't like this because my stories are kind of weird and hard to explain. But, I actually manage to pull it off very well and she's pretty impressed. Well, now my sweet little HB10 pops up again, and so does a gay guy friend of the HB9. They are a bit distracting and we kinda want to keep talking, but the guy friend kind of drags her off and she looks regretful. So, the HB10 and I talk, and when I tell her I like the HB9, she's like ""let's go get her!"". I guess she had noticed the HB9 and her gay friend head into the women's bathrooms, so we go in there to. Well, there's a little couch in there and everyone seems to be hanging there... my HB9 and some people the HB10 and I know. So, I sit next to the HB9 and we get chatting again, don't remember about what though. The HB10 leans over and starts telling the HB9 how awesome I am. It was so obvious, but really cute too. I wanted to get some kino going but was really overthinking it. I don't usually have that problem, so I think maybe it was more that the vibe just wasn't there.

Eventually, we get out of the bathroom. The club is closing soon, so I want to get the HB9 to bounce somewhere else with me since it's too soon to ask her back to my place. But, this is where something bad happens.... the HB9 asks how old I am. I'm 41 and she tells me she's 22. Ouch. I try to keep it over 25. I can tell she's not so cool with how old I am. She starts on about how she has to get up early, blah blah. So, I take the opportunity to get her to put her number in my phone. The HB10 shows up again and tells my HB9 something, I don't know what, but I'm almost certain it's more nice stuff about me. It's a bit childish, but hey, I am hanging out with kids. The HB9 was smiling though, so it was all good. Well, now the club really is closing and we are figuring out what to do next. I want to go party somewhere else, but everyone else just wants to go eat so we do that. There was no opening at all for me to try and k-close the HB9 otherwise I would have went for it to find out how put off she really was about my age. So, I just say goodbye to the HB9 and we head out.

Nothing much happens from there, except a little awkwardness because the HB9 and her friends showed up at the same place we went to get food. Small town. I didn't even notice her until the HB10 pointed her out. I just wave and say hi, but don't pursue any interaction with her. There wasn't any chance she was just going to leave and go home with me, so I didn't see any point. So, we just eat and have some laughs and then I hop in a taxi home... alone. :(

I don't know if I should text the HB9 or not. I really can't decide. I think she's a little too young and she probably thinks I'm a little too old, but I will very likely run into her again, so feel like maybe I should send her a ""was nice meeting you"" text today at least. It always feels a little awkward to me when I see a girl again after getting her number and not using it. I don't know. I probably won't bother, but what do you guys think?

EDIT: Well, the lesbian social network being what it is, word got back to me that the HB9 isn't interested, so I'm not texting her.

If I Were God

If I were God, I would create other Gods. Why create useless spirit beings who need to go through mortal probation before becoming gods and just skip straight to the end? And it just makes sense: humans make humans, cats make cats, dogs make dogs, and gods should create gods, not spirit beings. Any God claiming to be omnipotent and were not to do this is clearly not imnipotent, or is sadistic.

Assuming that is impossble (what is impossible to an omnipotent being?) then I would create human beings, but not perfect human beings. Why? Perfect beings are boring. It is our imperfections that make us interesting. However, I would not punish my creations for their imperfection, which I designed at least not the imperfect traits that harm no one. Murder is bad, but sexual relation outside of marriage is alright with me. I fail to see how it's a sin until a person obtain a paper stating that they are wed. However, cheating on your significant other would be a sin. 

if I were God, I would forgo a savior in exchange that we each suffer for our own sins, either while we're dying or shortly after, a Purification Process, as i would call it.. Now, before you imagine the suffering and agony that Jesus went through, keep in mind he suffered for everyone. That's 40 billion people he's suffering for. Divide his pain by 40 billion and i imagine even the weakest among us can overcome such pain. Not only would this make us more responsible for our actions, it would also ensure that everyone would get into Heaven and make Hell obsolete. 

While on the subject, if I were God, I would not send my spirit child, in my infinite love for him, to Hell. A spirit being who seeks to overthrow an omnipotent being doesn't deserve jail, they need to be put into a mental rehabilitation center for retardation. Why would I condemn someone such as this to eternal suffering simply because I need someone to test my human subjects? Truly only a sadistic God would do such an act. 

If I were God, I would not create microbial diseases. This seems unnecessary. And, I would eliminate hunger and thirst by simply making basic foods and fresh water more abudant (makes sense). No more starving, aids-infected children in Africa. Seems only fair that everyone start off on a promising foot, if not an equal one.

However, I just happened to miss an episode of one of your shows, and now I have no way of watching it. No option to watch it on discovery.com, no full episodes on Hulu, not on Fios OnDemand, and I do not see the episode I missed being repeated.  WTF, this is 2010.  Are you purposely doing this for future DVD sales or do you guys just not get it?  I find it so stupid that if you happen to not be in front of the TV at the right time or you did not set your DVR to tape, that you can not watch an episode of a show.

Lately things gave been getting worse, causing my mother to begin to think about divorce (she's gone to the lawyer already for preliminarily talks). Today I was woken up by my father yelling about something. I then heard a loud 'bang' and my mother yell for my sister. I rushed downstairs to see my mother on the floor. My father obviously claims she did it to herself (despite that not making sense at all). My mom claims her pushed her and tried to choke her. In the ensuing arguments, we were all threatened both physically and financially. To make matters worse my mother has a dangerous operation in a week.

My family needs your advice Reddit. What options do we have? What should we do? We are scared for our safety (we left the house), but have limited financial means to leave (mom is an under-paid secretary at a school and I'm a poor IT major. I'm sorry I'm so vague right now, but I'm just looking for any and all options you all can provide. Thank you in advance.

106087,"During all the funeral and services I didn't cry at all. I only cried a little, I bottled it all up. Over the past few weeks I haven't been sleeping full nights, but I don't feel tired during the day. Food doesn't taste as good as it use to. Even watching Always Sunny doesn't bring me the laughs it use to.

Over Thanksgiving when I was home, there was a memorial service and a dedication to him that our state senator attended, I started crying there a little but I bottled it up, but something was different. 

And over the past few days its been coming out more and more. Now I'm a wreck. Him dying may as well have happened today or yesterday. This is what happens when you bottle shit up.

The problem is I'm at University right now studying for finals and I can't concentrate at all. I have good friends here but I've only known them for over a year and half. I only have 3 true best friends here that I feel like I can tell them anything. I told 2/3 and they have been more than understanding. I just feel so fucked up. My third best friend is the one I have the most in common with and the one I like the most out of all them. But he has been putting the meeting off, but I don't think he has any idea what I'm going to tell him.

I just feel so fucked up right now and I don't want my friends to see me like this. But I do want the ones I consider family to see me, because I feel it will only further bond us. It is worth noting that all of them are connected to the Marines or ROTC. I guess thats the connection I feel the deepest with them.

My family at home knows that I've been having trouble with it, but even if they came out I don't have time to really meet with them because of finals. I communicate with them all the time, but they are a 7 hour car ride away, they haven't gotten over it yet and I don't want them to upset them more. 

I talked to a physchologist but it didn't help me at all. I talked to family and best friends in high school but they are so far away and technology is just not doing it. I need physical human reaction. I need human contact, not with my family but close friends if that makes any sense. I value loyalty and friendship above all other things. I know my family will always be there when I need them. But I have some insecure need (serious metacognition going on right now) to be with someone who isn't family. The act that there choosing to stay by my side because there not my family is even more meaningful for me. 

TL;DR - After one year and half I have just gotten over the shock of my cousins death and the grief and everything is hitting me like a ton of bricks.

After my breakup I started dating a girl I actually don't like a lot, just to hang out for the while. It has passed around a month and we have had sex a couple of times.
The thing is, after having sex, I feel terribly guilty about it. Don't know if it is for the chance that she could get pregnant (we always use protection, but Im over-paranoid about it) and the fact that I don't like her (not more than in a physical way) and have no intentions for her to be my gf.

109518,"Question:  My long-term girlfriend recently admitted to sending sexually explicit text messages to a former boyfriend.  I don't know whether to dump her, take it in stride, or what?

 Here's the deal:  

- I've been dating a girl on and off for about ten years. We started dating just as I was graduating high school and she was finishing her sophomore year.

- The relationship has been tough in a lot of ways.  Much of it has been long distance, given our different locations for college, periods where both of us were traveling abroad, and now, my attending law school.

- There have been a few major break ups.  After I finished college, I moved to the city she was studying in, but she broke up with me almost immediately upon my arrival.  I was heartbroken at the time.  She dated a few other guys.  I had a serious relationship with another girl for a bit, but pretty clearly never got over her.  It took me about three years, but I ultimately got her back.

- After I started law school, and the relationship had become long distance again (Boston to New York, so we see each other three or four times a month and summers), she proposed that we try an open relationship.  I flipped and broke up with her, not so much because I wasn't open to the idea, but because I felt pressured by her to accept her proposal, and I suspected there was a particular person she wanted to date.  I turned out to be right, but things did no go well with him.  She ultimately asked to get back together with me, and I accepted.

- About a year and a half ago, she confessed to having kissed a boy at a party.  She explained that she was totally drunk and apologized.  I let it go as a one time thing.  Despite the prior break ups, this was the first time, as far as I'm aware, that she'd ever done anything with another person while we were dating.

- Since then, things seemed to really stabilize.  We had a ton of fun over the summer.  She even began talking about getting married, and seemed to be very happy in the relationship.  If anything, tables seemed to have flipped, and I seemed to be the person more relaxed about the relationship, though by all means I was still happy to be with her.

- About a week ago, she confessed to getting drunk and sending sexually explicit text messages to both the guy she dated the last time we were broken up and the guy she kissed a year before at the party.

- This shocked me.  Whenever something had happened before, there had been plenty of warning signs.  She'd seemed totally fine with things.  At first I acted like I didn't care, but then I flipped out.  She apologized, but also said she felt like this was just something she had a problem with.  She downplayed it, saying it was only flirting, but also saying that she just wasn't sure she could guarantee that this kind of thing would never happen again.  I told I was seriously considering breaking up with her.  This seemed to really surprise and distress her, and she asked me not to, but I refused to commit either way.  

- A day later, I called her up late, waking her up.  After a few minutes chatting about random stuff, she started breaking down crying.  She said that the world seemed colorless over the time since she'd confessed.  She was under stress from a bunch of different places as well, but she claimed she was feeling suicidal.  She asked me again not to break up with her.  She said she still wanted to marry me.  She just doubted her ability to control her herself 100% of the time, and thought it shouldn't be a big deal if we do a little ""flirting.""  She offered to go to a relationship counselor with me.  I told her I wouldn't break up with her.  The idea of her killing herself hardly seemed worth a few naughty text messages, regardless of how explicit they were.  Furthermore, if possible, I would like to stay with her.

I don't know how to to handle this.  On the one hand, I'm totally in love with this girl, and as far as I'm aware, the worst of her behavior wasn't really that big of deal.  On the other hand, I fear that her behavior is indicative of a deeper imbalance in the relationship.  It bothers the hell out of me that she can't give me any meaningful assurance she won't ""flirt"" with other people again in the future.  And it super bothers me that the texts were not to people at the party, but to people she'd had some level of intimacy with before.  It would have been one thing if she'd just gotten caught up in the moment.

Thoughts?

EDIT: Formatting.  Also, thanks for responses so far.

EDIT: Just want to point out, breaking up with her would be extremely hard.  I've been with her a long time, and am deeply in love with her.  She may be manipulating me, but at the same time, I'm positive my leaving her would be absolutely devastating to her.  (I don't think those two things are entirely mutually exclusive.)  

Also, I listed the points of difficulty in the relationship above, but try put them in the context of knowing someone for ten years and dating them for most of that time, nearly all of which was filled with lots of good times and intimacy.  I may be deluding myself, but at this point, I still absolutely do believe that she loves me and that she's been honest with me.  For all of the above events, she could have easily hidden them from me, but chose not to.  While that doesn't justify anything she's done whatsoever, I value her honesty and give her some degree of credibility as a result.  While she says she can't guarantee she won't engage in ""flirtatious"" behavior, she points out that she has never done anything so serious as sleeping with someone else, or even close, and has no problem saying she wouldn't do that.

Please don't take this to mean I'm disregarding anyone's advice.  I'm not, even though it's hard advice for me to take.

EDIT:  The text messages were all text, not photos.

EDIT:  Look, when she said she couldn't guarantee it would never happen again, I think people are imagining she was being defiant.  It wasn't like that.  It sounded like it was coming from a place of remorse, like looking back over her own behavior, she was genuinely disappointed in herself, and now doubted her own self control.  I realize I'm being ridiculously forgiving in my assessment of what she was saying, but if I were to tell her she had to get her head straight and figure out if she really wanted to be with me, and if so, guarantee it wouldn't happen again, would that be reasonable?  

Or the only reasonable response is to flat out dump this girl that I've been dating for a decade?  I realize I'm the one asking for the advice, but I've got to suspect that anyone who cavalierly says dump someone you've been with for a decade has never done it.  It would be hard as hell.  This would be a lot like going through a divorce.  It's that serious of a relationship.  We're close with one another's family, etc.  It would be ugly and hard.

UPDATE:  Had a long conversation with her in which I made it clear to her that her getting herself to a place where she could tell me confidently and genuinely that this wouldn't happen again was an absolute condition of us moving forward.  As was deleting all her contact information for both of the people she texted.  She continued to claim she loved me, but was disturbingly non-committal.  She asked how long she could have to think about it.  I said a month tops.  She also agreed to set up a counseling appointment.  I realize that for most people that have commented, this would still constitute ""doormat"" behavior, but whatever.  Apparently, that's the ""toughest"" I know how to be.  Given the tone of her response, I strongly suspect we will be broken up soon enough regardless.

The main point of what I was thinking was that you have to gather resources and protect yourself from mobs like normal, but you also have to keep up with the other team building fortifications (perhaps a new refined stone that is harder to get through to make structures matter more) and building weapons. Maybe you can build a train station or port to trade resources you have a lot of at a disadvantage, like three coal for an iron and two iron for a coal, etc., even trade away gold at a favourable rate (making it valuable).

111399,"Seriously. This ""see something, say something"" business seems just like the red scare. There hasn't been a successful terrorist attack here in 9 years but we keep getting more and more swept up.

So when did we collectively stop taking seriously the suggestion to consider any stranger on the street a potential threat back then? Most depictions of the McCarthy era seem to depict it as being ""over"" when ol Joe was asked ""at long last, have you no decency?"" but surely the fear had to exist for some time after that. So how long was it? Did we all forget about it because of distractions from Vietnam, or was it all the acid you people were doing at Woodstock?

Whatever caused us to move on from that... we need some of it right now.

**edit:** In response to the myriad clever ""US over communists? HAHAHA"" responses: I think if I told my employer, parents, or friends today that I'm a communist (or even socialist) their response would be something like, ""Really? That's kinda weird."" If I said the same thing 50 years ago, I would be fired, disowned, put on lists, or at least villified. I think the whole Obama = socialist thing is just a way for us to say, ""Scary! Different!"" and nobody takes it seriously except idiots. The red scare ruined lives and careers, but today being called a socialist/communist is about the same (as far as reputation damage goes) as being called a ""known thespian.""

113317,"Hey reddit. Over the last three weeks, i have wet my bed a sum total of 3 times. This has happened to me a couple times before in the past, but never with this level of proximity and those incidents occurred after traumatic or distressing events. But that's not the case here. I've been on break for the last three weeks, i'm currently the happiest i've been in three years, except for this morning because it just happened again and i accidentally broke my phone in the panicked fray with my bed sheets.

A lot's happened over the last three weeks. First off, i quit smoking. I've only been a smoker for roughly two years. No patches, just cold turkey and to be honest i'm doing fine. Yeah, i get cravings but it hasn't been incredibly difficult except for right now as i'm typing this, and there are none in reach. I do smoke trees though.

Also, my sleeping patterns have changed suddenly. I'm 21 years old and a student. I'm used to being up all hours of the night working and getting 2-4 hours of sleep on average if i'm lucky enough to sleep at all. Suddenly, i get about 6-8 hours a night and my sleeping patterns have become regular seemingly overnight. Problem is, i zonk out around midnight without realizing it and might have had a lot of fluids in my system, but it's never been a problem before. I've come back from partying and clubbing unaware of a full bladder and it has never caused me problems.


Finally, there's this girl.... i'll skip the sappy stuff, but around three weeks ago i met this girl and she's great. She's the reason i've quit smoking and probably the reason i'm not stressing out about it. However, i'm wondering if the surge in hormones might be related. This is the first girl i haven't completely disregarded since my last relationship, and i haven't had these feelings in a long time.

Also, it's been happening early in the morning... between 5-7 a.m. during a dream. I vaguely remember pissing in my dream last night, but i can't be sure about the other times.

This is really making me worried, and i don't want to see a doctor yet. If the same thing happens again over the course of the week i will, but i'm not ready just yet so i thought i'd come to you guys first. Right now my thoughts are sounding like a bad episode of House. I don't know if things i mentioned are related or if all of this is merely coincidental. It's just that it's all happening at once. Please... if there's any advice you guys can give, i would appreciate it so much

Edit: TLDR; i'm wetting my bed

3x over 3 weeks

Possible related factors:
1) quit smoking
2) drastic shift in sleep pattern
3) love and raging hormones
4) weird ass dreams

Edit2: Spacing 

Edit3: Just so we're clear, i don't have bladder control issues when i'm conscious.  For the most part, i feel fine and i don't seem to be experiencing any other problems related to peeing or otherwise.  It's just that three times in three weeks is fucking weird.  

Edit4: Talked to my pops.  He's a little worried since he's a physical therapist (and my dad).  Both my parents are in the medical field.  I'm seeing the doctor tomorrow.  He thinks it's probably emotional or anxiety issues, but like i said i've been the happiest i've been in years.

While no one really participates in SS for the sake of what they can get out of it, it's certainly true that some put in more effort than others. And there's imbalance out there, some people might feel guilty to get something really crazy after being able to only afford a few minutes time to give back. 

Ultimately, there's two types of Santa's, those who enjoy dipping their feet in the water, respect the $15 suggestion, and see this as a fun little side romp-- and those who are in it for the glory: I'm talking the ones who want to go crazy and cyberstalk their giftee for weeks, who would commission a small statue or name a star after someone, those who refuse to rest until their giftee's year has been positively made.

So why not add a ""Secret Santa Plus"" of sorts. A place where the hardcore SS'ers can go, who can not only contribute like a star but might even get to enjoy the same kind of dedication back. While we all enjoy giving for the pure joy of giving, it's gotta be nice to know what the feeling is reciprocated. **Note: This is not about the money. The $15 range is still fine, no one is expecting iPads, it's about the effort.** 

This isn't about creating classes, but simply put, if you want to go the extra mile you can do so with people who you know are going to pay it forward with as much gusto as you have! If you're spending hours, it's gotta be great to know the person you're giving to is doing the same to someone else, right? Who knows, this might even challenge those who were happy on the sidelines to jump in and get their skin in the game.

The only issue would be: how would this be set up? It would have to be limited at first: perhaps only those who have contributed in previous years' Secret Santa events? This way you would filter out the scrooges (at least to an extent) who are just in it for taking and not giving.

114979,"Hi Reddit,

I have been programming web applications for about 1.5 years (PHP mostly).

I haven't been learning it in the 'correct' way of using either books or some sort of an online course. I used code examples and grew from there on by creating small applications and moved forward to making larger web applications.

I always learned stuff as I built my applications, so for examples, I never learned how to use sockets because I never needed to use sockets in any of my applications.


I want to try and learn new stuff without 'needing' them within my current application.

There are probably a lot of stuff that I didn't even know that exists therefore couldn't know if I needed them or not.

115235,"Hi,

Today I just need someone there. I don't feel very well.

Just gonna sum up most of the story: Was with this girl for three years, from age 23-26. Lived together for over a year. She moved out. She feel in love with someone new and we broke up - but they were together, before or after. Then after some time we started seeing each other again. Then I found out she had been cheating on me one time when we lived together. Wasn't together. Were together. Wasn't together. Were together. I sort of broke up. We started seeing each other again for a bit. Now I know that she found someone new - but she doesn't know that I know.

I guess this is the story about someone you should have left alone for over a year ago, instead of spending a long time being and not being with her. It's gotten inside my head now, and I can't get it out.

Feel sort of hungry, thirsty and tired. Cries a lot. Can't get my head straight and start doing the things I should be doing.

What is the problem I'm having and the reason I'm posting?

I don't know. I don't know what it really is. Maybe the fact that when we ended up being together again and I found out she had been cheating I never felt that she really said that she was sorry. I kept wanting to hear her say it and really mean it. And she did say it, but for some reason not the way I wanted to hear it. You know what I mean?

And now, I want for her to be unhappy. I don't want her to go on being happy and in love with this guy she just found. I want her to feel fucking miserable and have a lousy Christmas with her stinking family. Just typing this feels nice. It feels like hatred, which is a much more ""active"" feeling than setting here and pity myself.

She just found this new guy and in a day or two she is going to call me and tell me about it ""so that I don't find out from someone else"". I'm not going to pick up. I just deleted all her texts, and my texts to her. Then deleted everything we ever sent each other on facebook (a period of four years that just went bye-bye) and on email.

118800,"One of my best friends of 5 years went on a mission trip to Haiti last summer. She went with a church group that had 5 adults and 4 teenagers. They were there for 2 weeks, helped build a church/school and had a wonderful, yet difficult, time there.


Since my friend came back, she has had a very close relationship/friendship with the 4 teenagers. She has friendships with the other adults that were on the trip, but nothing like the kids. What makes this awkward for most people is that she is 48 years old. 3 of the kid's parents have asked her to stop hanging out with their kids so much, it makes them uncomfortable. The minister of the church and the couple that run the youth group have also talked to her about it, saying that it makes some of the adults (ie: the parents) uncomfortable. She doesn't listen. It has been perticularly difficult with one of the girl's mothers. Her mother has even gone so far as to take her daughters phone away and even move to a different church to keep them from seeing eachother.




My friend refuses to respect the parents wishes. She texts the kids constantly, during work, late at night (sometimes til 3am or later), she takes them places, and has sleepovers with the girls. She also tries to act more like a teenager now too, which is part of what bothers *me* the most.




I've listened to her outline the issues she is having with the parents and I have tried to stay unbiased and give her what I think is good advice. I've told her that she needs to think of how the parents feel in this situation. This just upsets her because she doesn't (and cannot) have children, so she get's defensive. I've also told her that some of these parents are overreacting and *could* think of this as an opportunity for their kids to have a positive adult rolemodel in their lives. The problem is, I don't think that she actually *is* a positive adult rolemodel. It's not that she is a bad person or does anything 'wrong' per se; it is that I see her conforming to their attitudes and behaviors and trying to be just like them.. so how is that a role model at all? My friend is vice president of a motorcycle ministry, is going to school to finish her bachelor's, owns her house and is very active in the community. I do not understand how a woman so strong minded and positive can all of a sudden start acting like any other teenage girl.



My friend has completely turned one of the girls against her mother. To the point that the girl has said as soon as she turns 18 she is leaving and wants to move in with my friend. As a mother myself, I have a really hard time with this. It makes me very angry to know that she is purposely defying this girl's parents. The girl was grounded from her phone, but my friend ""just couldnt wait weeks to talk to her again"" so she would call the girls friend and talk to her on that phone instead. Some of the comments my friend makes sounds more like a parent fighting for custody than a woman just missing her friend. She says things like 'how is their right to keep her away from me'. They email eachother and talk in code so that her mom doesn't know what they are really talking about. When she tells me these things I tell her it's wrong, but she gets defensive and will end the conversation.




Because of her new friendships with these kids, we spend a lot less time together. So sometimes I think maybe I am just being over critical because someone who is one of my best friends just doesnt have a whole lot of time for me anymore. But then I can't help but think, if this was my son or daughter, I would be furious if an adult friend did not respect my wishes. It is scary to see how much she clings to these kids and how much they idolize her. I've asked her what it is that makes her feel so strongly about them, and she cannot answer that. She says, she doesn't know.. just something about the trip to Haiti bonded them and she doesn't want to be without them.




Over the past couple of months my friend has made some derogatory comments to me that have really thrown me for a loop. They leave me thinking, did she really just say that? Indivdually they are nothing, but when you put them together it shows me that she has changed.. maybe too much for me. I am not even sure that I want to be her friend anymore and it is mostly because of her relationship with these kids. I just cannot wrap my head around it. feh.

1.  Everyone in the whole school hates Harry when his name pops up, even (and especially) Ron.  Harry has saved the school three times to this point, and obviously people are trying very hard to kill and undermine him.  Seriously??  Wouldn't throwing his name into a goblet and forcing him to compete in a ludicrously dangerous event be an obvious choice?  Everyone hates him again even after being proved wrong for hating him during the serpent speak incident.

2.  Is the staff of Hogwarts evil or incompetent?  They HAVE to be one of these choices, plain and simple.  So many teachers there have a purely evil agenda, and don't hide it very well.  Is Dumbledore that stupid that he can't tell this?  Does he not care?  They have potions and herbs and things that can see truth.  

3.  Why are the teachers constantly trying to kill the students?  I actually think almost everything bad that happened in the first 3 movies could have been prevented with competent guardianship, but this movie escalated from negligence to intent.  Seriously, the whole dragon thing???  Then they try to drown a bunch of students.  If Harry didn't actually free both of those kids would one of them have died?  Most action movies have a protagonist fighting against bad guys.  I honestly think 90% of the danger Harry Potter has faced from the first four movies has been from the faculty.

Worst of all, we get this 15 minute graveyard scene which was utterly boring.  I honestly fell asleep even though I wasn't tired, so I will admit I could have missed something interesting.  

I really felt that the whole time was spent on danger manufactured by the teachers, which leaves no suspense whatsoever since we know that Harry will not die.  What is to like?

I don't want to say anything dramatic or insane, I just want to email things, show her funny things I've found online, talk about life, whatever.  Nothing big.  I don't even care if she responds, I just want the right to say it...  But I can't.  She has a restraining order against me.  Not for ever being violent, just for ""harassing"" her.  It's a long story, and yes, in the past I was a huge asshole in various ways (and also good in various ways, I'm not evil, I've just been very confused for a long time), but all I've ever done is annoy her, I was never violent in even the smallest way.  Every email I send will cost me a year in jail, that's how restraining orders work, even just for harassment...

I can't control myself.  The impulse to communicate is incredibly intense, and if I don't act on it, I slowly lose my mind.  I don't expect anyone to understand, but just try to picture trying to hold your breath as long as you can.  You can do it for a while, but eventually that *need* to breathe becomes so intense that you just can't think of anything else but that.  That's how powerful this compulsion is to write her a text message or an email.  It's unbearable.  I already spent four days in jail over a text message, so I know that even one more day in jail is torture for me.

I really can't see any way to escape this.  There's no reasoning with her.  There's no way to ask her to accept being slightly annoyed just to save my life.  To even ask her that is a violation, and thus time in jail.  I see no way out except taking my own life.

I DO NOT want to die, but I prefer death than even one day in jail, and I know before the year is out I'll send an email, no matter how hard I try to fight the compulsion.

I feel like I'm trapped in an equation with no solution.  I don't know what to do other than this.  When the Cyanide arrives, I'm going to take a small vacation, far away from where anyone can find me, and I'll mix the solution with a glass of wine and see if this universe is really the end of it all or not.

I want to live, but how can I?  I don't think any of you can help, there's nothing at all that can help me, but I want to write this just once.  Maybe someone has some solution I've yet to consider.  I feel so helpless...

121509,"I'm a 22 y/o female, working on a master's degree in a scientific discipline.  I've never been in a relationship or dated anyone, mainly because I wasn't interested in having a relationship (friends were enough).  I often have more guy friends than girls as friends, just because I feel like a lot of girls spend excessive amounts of time talking about really banal things like shopping, relationships, ""girl talk"", etc., and I don't relate to that whole thing.  The friends I have are often people I think of as genderless in a sense, since I don't think they conform to a stereotype of one or the other's behavior.  This is more backstory on me than directly related to the question at hand. 

More recently, I've been feeling more like I'd like to date/develop a deeper relationship.  But I'm so old relative to the dating game that I am a bit clueless as where to start.  I also think that I don't have any personal need to date casually.  Not that I want to find some random guy and make a five-year-commitment off the bat for the sake of a commitment, just that I don't feel the need to develop romantic relationships unless I sense a real connection.  And while I think that I would fit with a pretty good variety of personalities, I do have some idea of certain dealbreakers that I know would bother me.  I'm wondering: are these too demanding?  Or, alternatively, where am I most likely to meet someone who fits these criteria?

1) Intellectually curious, and takes some level of pride in intelligence, continuous learning, intelligent conversation/debate, etc., on a wide variety of topics.

2) Kind.  A person who cares genuinely and deeply for the people in their life, and is generally charitable.

3) Good sense of humor - obviously subjective

4) Likes either dogs or cats

5) Good taste in movies and music and likes to read at least sometimes.  Taste is obviously also subjective, and is also not limited to what I like.  Should probably like either folk, jazz/blues, classical, alternative/indie or classic rock, though, music-wise.  If he shared my love for Tom Waits, I'd probably fall head over heels right there.

6) Not devoutly religious, or at least aware of or skeptical about religious basis.

7) Main hobby isn't video games.  I know this probably sounds kind of bitchy/stereotypically girly.  I like playing myself sometimes, although my lack of spatial intelligence means I'm not much good at any system more recent than super nintendo/sega genesis, but I know it's not something I could relate to and it seems like a waste of time instead of time that could be spent working on something in the ""real world"".  I suspect I'll take some heat for this one.  Also, key word is ""main hobby"" not a moratorium completely.  The other component to this is that because I know I feel this way, real gamer guys just wouldn't be happy with me either, and it's not like I want to change someone.

8) Politically on the liberal end of the spectrum and environmentally concerned, though no need for radicalism of any kind.

9) Enjoys board games of some kind.

10) Not pretentious or interested in social capital/entertaining/some kind of high class/rich lifestyle.  A modestly oriented, more lower-working-middle-class kind of person.

11) Isn't cynical about Christmastime.  By this I mean takes some level of joy in the season (or Hanukkah if Jewish).  I say this because I have struggled with depression in my life, and it's one of the things I'm most purely happy about, and I feel that if I was with someone constantly bringing it down, it would be somewhat bad for my mental health.

12) Doesn't use any kind of recreational drugs or smoke.  Drinking alcohol in reasonable amounts is fine.

As I went through that, it seemed like a lot, but also not a lot.  I could imagine a lot of different kinds of people who would fit these descriptions.  But then again, maybe it'd be hard to meet them.  Of course, one has to wonder whether this kind of person would be interested in me, a shy nerd-girl who fits these categories along with being somewhat crafty/artistic and liking writing, puzzles (both logical and jigsaw), and being somewhat childlike in my love of snow, children's books, and surprises.  I'm also overly self-critical, somewhat lazy/messy, and don't believe in withholding criticism because of my relationship to a person.  I've been called pretty by more than one person, but I don't generally think of myself that way, so that's a pretty hard call.

So to sum up, what's the best way to meet a thoughtful, unpretentious guy in his twenties?

EDIT: So, just to clarify, when I say ""criteria"" I'm somewhat loose with them.  But, this list should give you some kind of idea of a certain kind of person who generally comes to mind; that's what I'm looking for.  For instance, a guy who was really kind would trump a lot of the more specific criteria.  It's not like I'd meet some lovely guy and find out he wasn't that into Battleship and go, ""Oh-sorry!

122009,"I don't know what to do.  I heard the news tonight, but it didn't surprise me.

He didn't disclose many details but I already knew what was up--he looks and acts the same as he's always, but you only have to combine ""experimental medication,"" the vague notion that he might not be here in a year, and the lifestyle I've always known him for to put the three together.  

We go out to the bar about once every week or so, and every so often at the end of the night things seem to take a turn for the worse with him.  The line is always ""I'm tired"" and I've ran out of things to say.  But it's not like the tired that a healthy person feels after a hard night of drinking, it's the kind of tired you don't wake up from.  

His scene isn't my usual--I basically only drink around him, cut myself off early and provide a safe ride home.  But thinking about this, his life revolves around drinking to the point where we joke that he never has anything to eat nor drink that doesn't have alcohol.  In fact, since his HIV diagnosis a few years ago, I've probably only actually seen him eat a handful of times. 

And I heard the line again tonight.  ""I'm tired.""  It hurts, because I know he is--he works hard as fuck, has more personality and game in his finger than I do my whole body, but doing what he does five times a week will match anyone with their limits.  

I'm 28 and I've only known one person personally to have died of AIDS.  NC was healthy one year, and gone the next, and it still bugs me--he died at 26.   

NC's death changed my notion of things.  It's as if people seem to forget that HIV hasn't been cured yet, that it's manageable, blah blah blah.  And I know plenty of people with HIV--two dozen around--but none in the situation my friend is in.  

NC and I weren't that close, but my friend and I are.  I'm the only one that knows of my friend's condition.   

To me, it's the mental that will kill him.    I can't laugh or pass it off with my usual ""you'll be fine"" because I know he won't just ""be fine"" now.

Specifically, in heroic 5mans when there are trash pulls of between 2 and 5 mobs, how do you maximize your DPS?

I have tried nuking down just one mob at a time - but 75% of the time I aggro if I do that. 

I tried putting up IS/Moonfire on all 5 mobs and then nuking - but that seems to be lower DPS. 

For now, I usually put up IS/Moonfire on 1 or 2 mobs, and then nuke hard on a third. My hope is that in the time it took for me to do that, the tank has generated an aggro lead.

I'm just slightly OCD and I like to have a plan for the most efficient cast sequence. For bosses, I've got it down. But it's bothering me that for trash, I'm still basically just winging it every time. It seems like I should know ""This is the best way for moonkin to kill trash"", but I don't.

What happens is thus: I'll get a hangnail, or some other break in the skin. This will leave a ragged flap of dead skin. I'll bite the skin off. That leaves a ""trench,"" which gives rise to more edges of skin that I can feel. It bothers me, so I start biting at those as well. Soon, my fingertips look like beef jerky around the nails: ragged, red, and sometimes bleeding.

It's a nasty habit, and I'm constantly struggling with it. I'll go for months with perfect skin, only to fall back into it again for weeks or months (caused by nerves, usually).

the girl at work has recently ended a long term relationship and ever since has been excessively flirty. we had a little bit of alone time at work and i asked if she wanted to hang out outside of work. she said yes, and basically that ended up with us going out to dinner then we hung out at her place. we ended up laying around her bed listening to music. that was a week ago.

it seems like i am already ""in"" but there's more - she knows i have a gf and she even saw her in person a few days ago. not to mention we work together. other than that there hasn't been much indication of interest or lack thereof, aside from the flirting.

If you give them money, they will immediately pump it into the economy through retail sales.  This in turn, creates more retail/ production jobs and stimulates this portion of the economy.

The major criticism of giving money to rich people is they will simply keep it.  This would be sound logic if there wasn't a basic misunderstanding of the way rich people ""keep"" their money.  They generally tend to invest it.  It's not as if they throw it on a pile in their basement, they're rich because they're smart enough to make their money work for them.  Don't those investments do more to stimulate the economy in a much broader way than simply putting money into retail sales?  Please correct me, I want to hear the other side of this argument.

As a side note, I'm Canadian.  There is an argument to be made that stimulating retail sales in Canada doesn't do anything for us because nearly all of our retailers are American.  Our best hope to stimulate the economy is to give rich people money and incentivize domestic investing.  No?

We thought we found a great middle ground where they could enjoy Santa cartoons and stories because they saw him as fun pretend like Mickey mouse or Winnie the pooh. Now my son comes home one day and tells me that Santa is real because his teacher told him so. I was a bit pissed off when he recounted the story of his teacher convincing him that Santa is real. He knows not to tell the other kids that he isn't real because we have explained to him that some kids believe he is real and it wouldn't be nice to convince them otherwise, but from what he told us his teacher had them write letters to Santa, my son wrote his letter with the teachers helper and asked if he could take it home to me. They told him they were going to mail it to Santa, he said that was silly because mommy said Santa is make-believe and they proceeded to tell him that Santa is real and that only kids who believe in Santa get presents from Santa. I'm quite pissed off and I have a meeting (already set for the end of the semester) and I'm not sure how to bring it up.

I feel like I am being forced to give up my beliefs on keeping presents for Christmas in the background to spending time with family and everywhere we look it's being shoved in his face that he should be getting lots of presents if he is good, which we have been able to minimize and combat until this happened at school. 

So Mommit what do I do? Do I bring it up with his teacher or just let it slide and continue with what we were doing before?

it feels like my life is falling apart. I've lost almost all of my friends who i thought were close to me. so few of my friends actually talk to me, but seem to just forget about me when i'm out of sight. I feel so lonely when I see them all doing stuff together and not including me. one of my old floor mates from last year actually said that he only remembered me as ""Eric's roommate"" (Eric was my old roommate who was my best friend, the best roommate anyone could ask for) and that really cut me hard. My friends at home are all messed up too; my ex won't talk to me anymore; my best friend since we were 10 is now a raving pussy who can't stop whining about his gf; no one returns my texts anymore to do stuff on break, it just blows. 

this past fall I busted my ass so hard to get better grades (I slacked off last year a bit), but no matter how I worked I kept getting subpar grades. I'm really fucking smart but no matter what I do I never get good exam grades and it fucks up my semester averages. every effort never was enough, and no matter how hard I was working, the next day it didn't matter and I blew it by not seeing obvious that I would see as soon as it was handed back to me the next class. I would even be helping my classmates understand material, and then I get that same material wrong on the exam, it fucking kills me. I'm not failing out but I'm not doing as well as I could be, and that's what is getting to me more than anything.

All the girls I get close to end up just telling me that I'm more like a brother and we are just friends.  

It just seems like it's not worth it anymore, I feel like I've let everyone down and just don't want to keeping fighting it anymore.

125959,"I'll try to give the quick story. I'm currently 29/m 5'9"" 175lbs. 2 years ago I was over 200lbs (I think my highest recorded weight was 207lbs) and knew that I needed to do something serious about losing it and keeping it off.  In the past I had been an athlete, but hadn't done much physical since college.  After that realization, I found things like Crossfit (love it or hate it, it has helped me find better things in fitness) and the Paleo diet. 

I've made tremendous gains on my core lifts. **Current PRs being**: Squat 5x3 - 292.5lbs, Deadlift 1RM - 385lbs, Press 1RM - 125lbs (weak I know). 5k run PR - 26:57.

Through all of this though, I have had some injuries that have been major setbacks.

* Hip injury after running too much of a distance - Out of most working out for 3 months.
* Neck injury from what I thought was sleeping wrong (more on this later) - Out of doing most workouts for 3 months
* Some sort of elbow tendinitis that put me out of anything upper body for 6 weeks
* Currently coming out of a shoulder injury - prevented me from doing anything except running for the last 2 months. 

This current injury, as it turns out, stems from being extremely tight in the chest/lats/thoracic spine/teres major, which limits my mobility in my shoulders. This explains my terrible pressing ability, and also explains how I easily torqued my neck.  I'm currently in some very good PT and on my way to ""normal"" mobility.

Through all of this, I am grateful that I have made a change in priorities in my life, and will continue to keep fitness a priority.  However, I have still never achieved any sort of flat stomach... which is where the last of whatever fat on my body will probably leave me.  I suspect that this is because I have not once had a good solid 6 months of training in a row.  I know that a lot of it is diet, but when you're in an injured state, your desire goes out the window.

Religion is what you practice and believe in at church. 

It is a hope and faith of something, someone, etc...

It separates people and causes arguments. Religion usually includes the ""past"", a god or goddess, and some special person. 

People will argue over what happens after death because they were raised believing something.  Religion does not have proof, just faith.

And he said ""blow up the rocket"". So I fired the RPG thingie that luckily popped up (for some reason, but let's not question that) just when we needed it. I fired it up, I fired it low, I fired it high. I fired it with my settings, I fired it with default settings, I fired it about 60 times in all. Really. It was not fun. At all.

I never managed to alter its trajectory because *as soon as I fired it* the display was always the same : ""you fucked up"" 'or something to that effect). Which was displayed about half a second after I fired.

Anyway, that game now left my windows partition. All 8 Gb of it. More space for something that will hopefully be worth it.

So all in all, COD black ops was roughly 20 minutes of completely directive gameplay (shoot this, run there), and attempt 60 times this thing, although whatever you do you'll get the very same display (but still do it again or else you're screwed).

127780,"First off, this isn't a ""pity me"" post.
I'm just looking for insight and suggestions on how to turn my life around. I just feel like these past events and current situations are relevant to how I've ended up today.

- I've been sexually assaulted two times in my past, and after breaking up with an ex-boyfriend, I was locked in his basement and raped/beaten within an inch of my life. The sexual assaults were by family members, I came out and told my family but they deemed it a ""cry for attention"" and said they'd disown me if I went to the police. After the incident with my ex, I didn't go to the police because.. honestly, I wanted vengeance. I wanted to kill him and show him every bit of agony that I experienced. I know that was stupidity on my part and I should have taken legal action, but that has since been three years ago so I feel as there is no hope for that. I was also physically/emotionally abused by my family most of my life.
- I've been on medications and through therapy for about seven years. I've been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and it's something I've had to live with for the past four years. I am extremely distrusting of people's motives, have severe anxiety (to the point where something little can set me off and I'll end up throwing up and feeling like the world is closing in on me). I never felt like therapy or medication helped me, but even if I wanted to pursue it as an option again, I have no insurance or no job currently. I can tell in regard to my mental illness, I've made a lot of progress by myself these past few years. I am a lot better at handling the delusions, but the paranoia is always there. I've since become a hermit, pushed everyone out of my life, out of fear that I'm a terrible person not worthy of friendships or companionship. Everyone that has seen the ""real"" side of me has cut me out of their life.
- A year ago this month, I attempted to commit suicide and was found locked in the bathroom by my father, who took me to the ER. I almost died and had to be resuscitated. I'm not currently suicidal, just.. very empty and apathetic a lot of the time. I feel like my entire life is just doing something to fill up the days.
- I feel like any man that tries to befriend or date me only does so because I'm ""pretty"". This insecurity stems from my ex-boyfriend emotionally demeaning me, telling me what a fuck-up I am, and that my only redeemable quality is that I've been blessed with ""a beautiful exterior shell"". 

I've been going to school full-time trying to make something of myself. Still, I'm very depressed and spend the majority of my time locked in my room playing video games, reading, or browsing reddit. I find it hard to make friends because of my paranoia and the fact I'm probably very intimidating and hard to approach to most people.

I just want to know what I can do to change.

I have a bit of a musical conundrum. I am deeply in need of new music, but recently I haven't found much that I can really get fully into. What I look for in music is a complex mood - a unique conveyance of emotion (usually tempered with hopelessness) - articulated by heavy guitars and intricate guitarwork.

I'm not a fan of the eternal blastbeat - I certainly enjoy blastbeating but like my drumming to be dynamic.  Mix the blastbeats in with your drumming, don't mix drumming in with your blastbeats.  I also don't enjoy low-quality sound, as is common in black metal (I can still enjoy black metal, though).  

I've recently been hanging out in the sludge / stoner doom camps, and have recently been spilling into post-rock, but I'm willing to go to most subgenres of metal.

(True culinary success can be measured by the number of trips for seconds and the amount of leftovers...)

I grew up with the meat version of this dish and it was one of the few meat-based recipes that I really missed when I became a vegetarian. After some experimentation, I came up with the following recipe:

**Vegetarian Kartoffelgratin**

.

2 cups	Lentils

4 cups	water

1/4 cup	Soy Sauce

Garlic

.

1 cup	Bulgur Wheat

.

1	Yellow Onion - chopped

Garlic

2 Leeks - sliced (with white) and thoughly rinsed

1 large Can of whole tomatos - chopped

3 Tbsp	Chopped fresh basil

.

4-6	Potatos, sliced

Peanut Oil sufficient for frying

Garlic

.

1/4 cup	Butter

1/4 cup Flour

1-2 cup	Milk

1/2+cup	Real Parmesan Cheese

.

- Combine the rinsed Lentils with the water, soy sauce, and garlic and cook until done.

- Meanwhile, soak the bulgur wheat in a sufficient amount of boiling water until it becomes ""chewy""

- Drain both the bulgur wheat and the Lentils and gently mix together

- Fry the garlic and onion in the oil until the onion is about half-way ""done""

- Add the Lentil-wheat mixture and gently fry, adding additional peanut or olive oil as neccessary
(the more the better!)

- Fry for about 5-10 minuites and add the Leeks, tomatos, and basil

- Fry, stiring gently until the leeks are ""mostly"" cooked

- Gently spread this mixture into the bottom of a LARGE baking dish

- Fry the potatos in a single layer with the garlic and cover the lentil-wheat mixture the fried potatos

- Meanwhile, melt the butter in a small saucepan and add the wheat, working it into a smooth mixture

- Add the Cheese, stiring constantly, and begin adding the milk 1/4 cup at a time; working in each portion until it is hot

- pour the cheese sauce over the potatos

- bake, covered for 20 min at 400dF (220dC); uncover and bake for an additional 10 minuites




I know, the soy sauce may sound weird, but in small amounts, and when cooked, it brings a savory non-soy-sauce flavor to the dish. Don't skip it. It's really quite essential. Also, I did not mark how much garlic to put in. It works pretty well with any amount of garlic as long as you don't go overboard. This dish is good with a light red wine.

I know that it's not too detrimental to my life or my health but it is to my work ethic and emotional stability. I'm kindof a mess right now so I'm going to be all over the place but I see two main issues with my marijuana addiction, that is, two things that I dislike about it. 

The first is what I've already mentioned. I'm almost disgusted by the level at which I enjoy smoking pot. Today I reached the bottom of my bag and my entire town is dry for the first time in a very long time. Today I tried to take it slow, smoked one bowl in the morning (as opposed to my usual two or three) and went out, tried to get my mind off the near-empty bag. I went and processed some paperwork and procured some other intoxicants (alcohol). I managed to spend the day out of the house without acting on the urge to roll a spliff or hit a bowl, and the urge was strong as usual. You might ask, as I sometimes do, `why is it so important that you make your stash last or that you get more right away? You know you'll get some sooner or later` And I don't really know the answer. It must be the addiction, I think. The sense of security I get when I know there will be some more to smoke later, to go to that special place. 
- Anyway, I made it home and I start drinking to see if that will curb my desire to smoke pot, it didn't. I saw something on television and all of a sudden became very depressed and my mood wasn't improving by the lingering fact that I won't be able to get more pot anytime soon. From there my emotional state took a nose dive.
I hope that mess of a rant gives you an idea of my first disdain for my marijuana addiction, the level of addiction itself and how it effects me.

My second beef with pot is that I'm incapable of controlling my use. If I spent just a little time getting my days in order, scheduling myself and taking account of the way I spend my time then perhaps I would be more responsible with my usage and it wouldn't be as important to me that I got high anymore. 

Right now I'm afraid. I'm afraid because I just smoked up and all my depressive thoughts, anxieties and worries went down the drain. It's not that I don't care, it's that the problems seem to dissolve around me. I have a bit more left, one, maybe two bowls. I'm afraid I won't be able to handle when this stuff runs out. Some advice would be nice.

131046,"Here's what I would have liked to have seen happen.

First of all, I would have liked Dexter, Chase/Lumen, and Deb to have gotten to the camp in a more interesting way. Chase's ""trap"", which basically consisted of Dexter having poor reactive driving skills, was retarded. It's his own turf, he should have been laying in wait the second Dexter opened one of the doors and ambushed him there. Secondly, Deb finding the place based on an immigrant selling fruit who had a chance encounter with Jordan telling her that the only thing down that direction was a camp? Retarded. They could have had her call up the same guy Dexter did, have him say he already told Dexter the information, leaving Deb wondering why the hell Dexter would want to know.

This would then cause her to race to the camp, where Dexter has already outsmarted Chase, freed Lumen and let her kill him. Dex and Lumen have an emotional moment, and then Dexter tells her they better start cleaning up. Meanwhile, Deb is arriving at the camp. She is on edge as she silently comes down the steps, finger on the trigger. Lumen suddenly walks around a corner, and Deb accidentally shoots her. Realizing what she's done, she drops her gun and begins freaking out. Dex, who is off in another room stuffing Jordan's arm into a bag, comes running around, clutching his knife. Deb sees her brother there, covered in blood, and Dex sees his sister standing over Lumen's body, and we see both of their faces for a split second before it cuts to black. 

Come back from commercial, and we see Batista in the interrogating room with Quinn, pointing out all the evidence against him. He then tries to sympathize, telling him he doesn't believe he did it, but he needs to know who Liddy was spying on, asking for anything to go on. We see Quinn struggle with whether or not to answer.

Come back to the scene with Deb and Dexter, and we see both of them unravel simultaneously. Deb scrambles for her gun, pointing it at Dexter as she breaks down crying, saying ""What the fuck Dex?"" over and over again and then demanding an explanation. Dexter just stares at her, holding the knife, unable to process what has happened. Eventually, he snaps out of it and realizes he has to take charge of the situation. He overpowers Deb, gets her gun, and knocks her out. The season then ends with him looking at the carnage around him, with his internal monologue saying something about how he knew it would eventually come to this. Harry stands over Deb's body, looking at Dexter with disgust and disappointment in his eyes.

This would make for an incredibly interesting start for Season 6: Dex has to get rid of Chase and Lumen's bodies, keep Deb as a prisoner until he knows he can trust her to keep quiet, and then Quinn is sitting in a jail cell with information linking Dex to Liddy's murder. Would make for a great final season in which we watch Dexter slowly become more and more unhinged. But of course something like this wouldn't ever happen because the writers have no balls.",-1,-1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I think the only reason I'm not doing it right now is because I couldn't do that to my family, but I'm almost past the point of caring about them anymore.

All I do is play games, I hate doing college work so much, I'm so far behind on all my work because I FUCKING HATE IT. When I'm at college all I do is browse reddit, I pretend to everyone that I'm going to attend university when I finish my course, but I know I'm not, all I want to do is play video games, it's my addiction I guess, some people are addicted to heroin, some to meth, but me, it's video games, but I love to play video games, I don't want to do anything else. I've never had a girlfriend which really cuts into me when I'm lying, alone and cold in bed at night, more and more lately I've been crying myself to sleep, and on top of that I'm gaining weight at a pretty steady weight, which just makes me more fucking angry and depressed with myself. I'm a fucking mess basically, who can't and doesn't want to do anything with his life but die. I put on a pretty normal existence to everyone however, I lie constantly about things I haven't done or am not going to do just so I don't look like that fat anti-social loser who does nothing and has no friends, let me tell you something else too...

I fucking hate the world, we live in a shithole, our planet is an awful awful place and I want to leave it, I honestly don't want to live to see what we become in the future, we will leave an even worse planet for our children and grandchildren to live on, and no one even cares, I don't even care really, It's just something that eats away at me and I've come to accept as fact, even though I'm sure some people live very happy lives, not me though, nothing but sadness.

I guess, growing up, my life went from one extreme to another, sometimes life would be great, but my dad was an alcoholic, I mean he smoked weed too, but it was just to help him sleep, hell I'm kinda glad he smoked weed, It was a lot better than when he was drunk, fuck, he'd always stay out overnight and there would be weekends where I wouldn't even see him, I always thought I'd never see him again, him and my mum always argued, he sometimes hit my mum, but only when drunk. He cheated on her twice, my mum took him back after the 1st time, and for the first couple of years or so it was great, but things quickly when tits up and he was back to old ways, and he knows he fucked up massively with my mum, and he regrets all the things he did, but you know, I'll always love my dad but I'll always associate those bad times with him, and it pains me so much to think of him that way, and I'm slowly starting to hate my mum, because all she ever does is say bad, horrible things about him infront of me and my brothers faces, I fucking hate it. My dad never says a single thing bad about her either, it's just out of spite when she says the stuff she does, and I hate it. I'd say it's fucked me up somewhat mentally, but I don't know, in my mind I know I'm messed up, but there's no way in hell I can convey my mental state in text.

I've probably missed some stuff that I'd like to have putten down for all you anonymous people that I have never met to have read, but I guess that's for another time, I don't know what has come over me, I wouldn't usually do anything like this, I guess I had an epiphany of sorts, if I don't get help soon then I don't know what's gonna happen.

And I'm not talking ""oh look, there's a cloud that vaguely resembles Homer Simpson"". I'm talking ""holy shit that *is* Homer Simpson"". Sometimes, I could even see it in colour. I also found that, as the clouds moved, the images would change slightly, and my brain would basically animate them. At one point I saw a helicopter hovering in the sky, rotors spinning and everything as it swayed back and forth.

Most amazing of all, however, was that my brain would generally not ""see"" patterns that were outwardly familiar, insofar as I see them on a regular basis, but rather create whole new concepts that my conscious mind was not aware of ever seeing before, like a snake using its mouth to remove a Greek theatre mask from the face of Zeus.

In closing, I found this to be the most incredible experience I have ever had while high. I recommend it to all of you.

[Omnitron](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8xa-NY7LfE&amp;feature=player_embedded)

***Main Abilities***

4 Bosses with 3 Abilities

**1. Toxitron**

**a.  Poison cloud**:  Green aoe on floor.  Don't stand in it.  But if you can kite Constucts into it, it will damage them as well as us.

**b.  Poison Soaked Shell**:  Stacking dot applied to any that hit him (i think only melee) increases your damage.  Take a couple stacks, but stop attacking at 3(maybe?).

**c.  Poison Protocol**:  Three Putricide slimes will target anyone except MT.  Must be burnt fast and must not touch their target.  If they do they blow up for ~100k damage to target and leave a puddle of bad on the floor.



**2.  Electron**

**a. Lightning Conductor**:  Random raid member becomes charged and must get away from raid.  They take no damage from this but the cause aoe damage to anyone near by.

**b.  Electrical Discharge**:  Herp Derp Chain Lightning.  Up to 3 members can be hit if within 8 yards of each other.

**c.  Unstable Shield**:  10 sec shield that deals damage to raid if attacked.  So don't.



**3.  Magmatron**

**a. Incineration Security Measure(ISM)**:  Big ass flame jets spray outwards in 360degrees.  Unavoidable, must have heals.  (Bubble is probably awesome for this)

**b.  Acquiring Target**:  High damage to one person.  A beam will show between him and them.  They must move to a position where no one is between him and them.  Raid awareness folks.  Don't be in the middle of beam before fire blast comes out.

**c.  Barrier**:  Stop attacking the boss because if you break this shield 70k damage is dealt to erryone.



**4.  Arcanotron**

**a.  Power Generator**:  Pretty puddle on the ground that **healers and dps SHOULD stand in**.  Nice buff to deeps and mana regen.  Keep boss out of here.

**b.  Arcane Annihilator**:  100k damage to random single target.  Must be interrupted.

**c.  Power Conversion**:  Huge stacking buff to bosses dps.  Must be spellstealed or purged.




***Procedure***

We will never be fighting more than two of these guys at a time.  In fact after the first golem starts we will fight two the whole time.  The bosses are on an energy timer.  This timer will tick down and start 1 of 5 things.

**First pull: 100%  Golem 1**

First golem becomes active and is targetable and dps'able.  Heed abilities and burn as best you can.  Main tank pick up this boss.  

**50% Golem 1 / 100% Golem 2**  

At 50% energy on the first golem, a second golem will become active and dpsable.  OT pick this'un up.

**45% Golem 1 / 95% Golem 2**

5% energy later the first golem will use its shield ability so dps should switch to number two (unless number one has an interruptable/stealable ability - in this case keep the capable dps member on #1, not dpsing but ready for int/steal).  

**25% Golem 1 / 75% Golem 2**

20% energy later the first golem's shield will fall off.  

**0% Golem 1 / 50% Golem 2 / 100% Golem 3**  

25% energy later the first golem will be at 0% and become inactive, and the third golem will come up.  Prepare for shield ability on Golem we are dpsing.  MT get G3.

**45% Golem 2 / 95% Golem 3**

5% later #2 pops shield.

Rinse and Repeat.

4 bosses share a mana pool.  

Seems chaotic at first glance, but we once thought BP was hectic.  

***Strategy***

While Toxitron is up:

Stay spread out.  Don't stand in Green stuff.  Burn the shit out of slimes.  Maybe kite boss into poison cloud.  Get a few stacks of soaked shell to increase dps.

Big heals during ISM.  Stay out of laser beam.  Don't attack during shield.

Stand in buff pool.  Interupt Annihilator.  Spellsteal buff.

Run away if you get Conductor.  Spread for Chain Lightning.  Don't attack during shield.

***Main Abilities***

4 Bosses with 3 Abilities

**1. Toxitron**

**a.  Poison cloud**:  Green aoe on floor.  Don't stand in it.  But if you can kite Constucts into it, it will damage them as well as us.

**b.  Poison Soaked Shell**:  Stacking dot applied to any that hit him (i think only melee) increases your damage.  Take a couple stacks, but stop attacking at 3(maybe?).

**c.  Poison Protocol**:  Three Putricide slimes will target anyone except MT.  Must be burnt fast and must not touch their target.  If they do they blow up for ~100k damage to target and leave a puddle of bad on the floor.



**2.  Electron**

**a. Lightning Conductor**:  Random raid member becomes charged and must get away from raid.  They take no damage from this but the cause aoe damage to anyone near by.

**b.  Electrical Discharge**:  Herp Derp Chain Lightning.  Up to 3 members can be hit if within 8 yards of each other.

**c.  Unstable Shield**:  10 sec shield that deals damage to raid if attacked.  So don't.



**3.  Magmatron**

**a. Incineration Security Measure(ISM)**:  Big ass flame jets spray outwards in 360degrees.  Unavoidable, must have heals.  (Bubble is probably awesome for this)

**b.  Acquiring Target**:  High damage to one person.  A beam will show between him and them.  They must move to a position where no one is between him and them.  Raid awareness folks.  Don't be in the middle of beam before fire blast comes out.

**c.  Barrier**:  Stop attacking the boss because if you break this shield 70k damage is dealt to erryone.



**4.  Arcanotron**

**a.  Power Generator**:  Pretty puddle on the ground that **healers and dps SHOULD stand in**.  Nice buff to deeps and mana regen.  Keep boss out of here.

**b.  Arcane Annihilator**:  100k damage to random single target.  Must be interrupted.

**c.  Power Conversion**:  Huge stacking buff to bosses dps.  Must be spellstealed or purged.




***Procedure***

We will never be fighting more than two of these guys at a time.  In fact after the first golem starts we will fight two the whole time.  The bosses are on an energy timer.  This timer will tick down and start 1 of 5 things.

**First pull: 100%  Golem 1**

First golem becomes active and is targetable and dps'able.  Heed abilities and burn as best you can.  Main tank pick up this boss.  

**50% Golem 1 / 100% Golem 2**  

At 50% energy on the first golem, a second golem will become active and dpsable.  OT pick this'un up.

**45% Golem 1 / 95% Golem 2**

5% energy later the first golem will use its shield ability so dps should switch to number two (unless number one has an interruptable/stealable ability - in this case keep the capable dps member on #1, not dpsing but ready for int/steal).  

**25% Golem 1 / 75% Golem 2**

20% energy later the first golem's shield will fall off.  

**0% Golem 1 / 50% Golem 2 / 100% Golem 3**  

25% energy later the first golem will be at 0% and become inactive, and the third golem will come up.  Prepare for shield ability on Golem we are dpsing.  MT get G3.

**45% Golem 2 / 95% Golem 3**

5% later #2 pops shield.

Rinse and Repeat.

4 bosses share a mana pool.  

Seems chaotic at first glance, but we once thought BP was hectic.  

***Strategy***

While Toxitron is up:

Stay spread out.  Don't stand in Green stuff.  Burn the shit out of slimes.  Maybe kite boss into poison cloud.  Get a few stacks of soaked shell to increase dps.

While Magmatron is up:

Big heals during ISM.  Stay out of laser beam.  Don't attack during shield.

While Arcanotron is up:

Stand in buff pool.  Interupt Annihilator.  Spellsteal buff.

While Electrion is up:  

Run away if you get Conductor.  Spread for Chain Lightning.  Don't attack during shield.

I'm not going to copy it all here, because there's no point (as you can just go there and click instead of here), and the list I've made is based mostly on texture packs created by the reddit community, or ones at least that have done well here and are well-liked/popular.

Lots and lots of people come in to the gym and bench 225 every Monday and Friday for years, never even attempting to increase the weight, sets, reps, speed, or pace between sets. Some don't care, but some are genuinely puzzled that their bench doesn't go up, even though they have not asked it to. Your bench strength doesn't adapt to the total number of times you've been to the gym to bench, or your sincerest hope that it will get stronger. It adapts to the stress imposed on it by the work done with the barbell. Furthermore, it adapts to *exactly* the kind of stress imposed on it. If you do sets of 20, you get good at doing 20's. If you do heavy singles, you get better at doing those. But singles and 20's are very different, and 
you don't get better at doing one by practicing the other. The muscles and nervous system function differently when they do these two things, and they require two different sets of skills and abilities, and thus cause the body to adapt differently. The adaptation occurs in response to the stress, and *specifically* to that stress, because the stress is what causes the adaptation.

If you have seen the movie, you'd know that the female protagonist invites Jim Carrey's character to go up to the frozen Charles with her and they drive all the way from NYC just to lay on the ice. Well, we're in CT near NYC, and we met online and clicked right away because we both had Eternal Sunshine references in our profiles.

We're planning on taking a trip up to Sunapee next week before Christmas and I would like to make a ""detour"" and stop by the Charles and propose there; most definitely at night. Is the Charles frozen yet? Are there any good areas where it's accessible and we can park our car nearby? Looking at Google Maps, I am thinking preferably near the Christian Herter Park, because the river isn't that wide and it looks like public space.

Before anyone points it out... of course we won't go on the ice if it is weak... in that case it would be by the river, not on it.

&gt;**Why did the court change its previous decision to deny Assange bail?**

&gt;Everyone in the UK is entitled to a ""presumption of bail"", which means they have the right to remain at liberty unless or until they have been convicted by a court. But prosecutors can deny that presumption if they show a defendant is at risk of absconding. Assange's lawyers and supporters were able to offer the judge sufficient conditions to overcome those fears. If he is freed after the appeal, his supporters will have had to have provided a security of *£200,000* – which would be forfeited if he absconds – and two sureties, each of *£20,000*. **[ergo, a total of GBP 240,000.]**

Now, I'm not saying we have to get all of it together, or that I've got a website up and running ready to accept 240,000 pounds (or equivalent) of your hard earned money - I'm not - But surely there is somewhere out there on the great big webernet where there's a reputable person who's a supporter of him that's got a donation page up for him? And if there is, I ask you, maybe we could get behind it?

I, for one, feel I could do a bit for fighting for freedom of speech if I could a donate some money to a worthy cause like that.

* We have GitHub, most awesomest *social network* on the internet.
* We have RubyGems, centralized libraries for everything.

* We have Rails, possibly the best web framework available (django people please don't burry me alive)
* We have RSpec and Cucumber, which make me cry when I have to work with JUnit.

Okay so I've been dating my girlfriend for about 2 1/2 years and we've been ""physical"" for almost 3.

Not to say that our sex lives are boring (quite the contrary!) but I've noticed we pretty much have a routine:

One of us will finger the other, eventual penetration with 2 fingers occurs. Oral sex ensues, where the receiver is laying on her back, legs spread, and the giver goes between the legs. From what I understand this is pretty standard for oral sex.

We usually switch off from there and the receiver becomes the giver, etc. Rinse, repeat.

I recently purchased a vibrator and we've only used it twice. My girlfriend isn't too sure she likes it (but she did get incredibly wet from it last time we used it!). It's a rabbit-type vibrator, and I used it mainly for penetration because the vibrating on her clit didn't seem to do much for her. Same goes for me, though I'm pretty sure I enjoyed the penetration from it :) It was just an odd sensation...we both decided it felt like it was making us feel like we had to poop almost. Weird!

Anywho, I've been trying to spice it up a little and I asked her to give me one new idea for us to try the next time we have sex. She read a bit and watched some videos of different positions but she couldn't get into them (she said they looked kinda awkward and if the position went wrong -ie, we started cracking up because of how silly it is- it may end up ruining the mood).

Sooo... I just thought I'd ask. What do you guys suggest? What's your favorite (girlxgirl) positions? We're not looking for anything too crazy, so I'd say keep it fairly vanilla, but I'd like to see any suggestions you may have. :)

PS: I'm super low on money right now so I'm unsure if I'd be able to purchase another toy to help our sex adventures along :(

PPS: This doesn't really have to even be ""positions"" per se, but anything that might spice up our sex lives :)

TL;DR: Our sex life is getting too routine, help!

So does anyone want to commit to 30 days of meditation starting January 2nd (to be compassionate to those of us who might be hungover January 1st)? As little or as much practice a day as you want.

**edit:**

Since there's a bit of an interest I think it's a go.  Everyone should think about how much time a day they'd like to commit.  For beginners, committing 5 minutes is probably way better than committing an hour -- it's more important to do it every day than it is to just do one long session and get burnt out, or to commit to an amount of time you simply don't have or aren't ready for.  Also, just because you only commit a low number (5 minutes) doesn't mean you can't practice more if you want.

Also, if you miss a day, it's more important to start back up the next then just quit the whole thing.  Starting back up after missing a day is probably another more important thing for a beginner (because you're going to miss a day) than it is to strictly practice every day.

There are some issues on which i could really use some 2X advice.

Background:  
XY here, been living in the US for some time, coming from a different culture. I faced a very humiliating rejection in my teens, 10 years later, still single. I've never really had issues talking to or being comfortable around women from my culture and have good female friends as well, but I haven't managed to trust anyone enough to go beyond that point. The few times that I've felt any feelings of attraction beyond basic friendship have been accompanied by unpleasant(to say the least) flashbacks of the past.  
  
To add a few issues to my burden, i came here a few years ago and have a (non-US) accent and despite my wit/fluency, etc it seems to bother a lot of people, I can't even imagine approaching a girl with it.  
  
Never been big on bars/lounges (though i can handle my liquor) and wanted to find out any other places that I can genuinely meetup without appearing to be a creepozoid. Some of my friends suggested Salsa clubs.

141082,"Today I got a phone call: ""your sister is in the hospital with a broken limb"". As the stranger told me: she left her home, got on a motorized vehicle and the throttle got stuck and now she's screaming in pain in the ER.

Back Story: my sister is a liar, cheat and reliably unreliable. She's the kind of person that will say she'll be there then text for hours during your big moment saying ""got lost"" or ""had to give someone keys"" or ""fell asleep"" all the while giving you the impression she'll show up but never does. It's always lies. I think she actually believes her excuses.

She'll also come over and give you a sob story about how she has no money and needs to use your computer to ""find a job"". You say ok, sure. Use it but I need to get back to work, How does an hour sound?

Cut to 2 hours later and I'm explaining how I set a clear boundary and she needs to give up the goods because I work from home and need to get back to work. This all the while I'm feeding her and giving her things to sell at the local consignment store.

She's been a heroin addict for a few years now. But beyond the heroin she's just your normal trouble maker. Constantly stealing and justifying it because she has no money. To her the world owes her everything. She's a practiced scam artist. Has developed a fake name to go with the fake social security number. This is used with cops and for medical attention.

Over the past year and a half I've kinda cut her off. 

Every reach out I get is over text and in some attempt to help her.

I've moved into the mindset that I do not want to meet her where I am in any but a position of a peer. 

I'm simply broken. I don't want to get hurt anymore. I feel terrible guilt, shame and regret that we don't have a relationship where I can show up to make my little sis laugh in her time of need.

But I can not do it anymore.

I don't want her drama.

I've done my work. I've shaken a lot of the shackles from chaotic family of origin. Got my obsessions, compulsions and addictions under reasonable control.

After getting this phone call today all I could do was imagine the worst. I'd show up to the ghetto hospital. Not be able to find or get in touch with her because as usual she's unreliable.

Let's say I did. Then what?

She's perpetually homeless. She'll want to stay in my tiny apartment I share with my comes-from-a-healthy-family partner. I would never do that to my better half. This is our home and it must be a calm and safe place. After growing up like we did and refuse to live with the same chaos and drama if even for a second.

Ya see, if my sister had the ability to respect the boundaries for others then it would be different. But she is still so incredibly resentful with me and it comes out with every interaction.

I think she looked up to me way to much for my age. In her mind I let her down. 

I'm rambling here aren't I?

here's what I would like. 

Help me find the correct and healthy mind space to deal with her.

I know the hardest part is that I want to change her. I know this is a big part of 12 step/co-dependent work. You must accept that you can't.

But even if I can't. How do I have even the smallest relationship with someone so resentful, so self-centered and so far away from what is actually happening?

and what I mean is she did this to herself. Her carelessness is a part of her disease. She is actively trying to hurt herself.

I made it clear 3 years ago. If you end up in jail, I will not bail you out.

144880,"Have some time today before work today so I decided to write this.  I'm using a throwaway since I don't want to look like some jerk off who's bragging about the rare occasions he's hit a homer run.

One thing I frequently reflect on is times I've been ""in the zone,"" and had incredible success with women.  These times have been rare, but they have happened.  One thing I quickly realized was that with these girls I didn't engage in long drawn out conversations.  There's three times in particular I always think of when trying to recapture that feeling:  

1.) Met these 2 girls downstairs at a party.  I very quickly got them both back up to my room.  Within 20 minutes I had met them, gotten them up to my room, hooked up with both of them.  The one I spent the rest of the night hooking up with, the other I would hook up with a week or two later in a sexual experience I still masturbate to.  (I'll come back to this night later on).

2.) Met girl at friends house.  Within 5 minutes we were heading back to my house to have sex.  We'd have sex a few more times after that.

3.) Met girl at New Years party.  Her friend was crying about having lost her purse.  I said something along the lines that her friend needs to stop fake crying for sympathy and attention.  Immediately started hooking up with her in hallway, and had sex with her that night.           

I don't remember what I said to any of them, but I remember how I felt.  Everything just came together.  I was sexual towards them in a way that was apparent and unapologetic.  I certainly didn't use any lines or techniques.  I made what I wanted pretty clear.

Then I think of times I tried to present myself as being a brilliant, comfortable in his own skin, conversationalist.  I usually could hold a girls attention for quite awhile as she talks about whatever and I relate.  I made sure to ""DHV,"" as much as possible.  I make her laugh and we have a grand ole time.  In the end though, I can't think of one time I even so much as got more than a number off a ""great"" conversation.  Often this baffled me, since in the beginning I was convinced this girl was nuts for me.                

I then thought back to that night with the 2 girls I talked about earlier.  After I had hooked up with them for awhile, we needed more drinks.  Long story short I invited one of my friends in to come hang while we drank (for the record, I wasn't trying to help him out or anything like that).  He had no idea what had happened prior to his entering the room.  He almost certainly took an interest in the one girl and began talking to her:

""So where do you live this year?""

""What's your major?""

""How's that going?""

""Do you know X?""  

She was polite, and responded to all his questions.  Outwardly, it seemed they were having a decent conversation.  But her attitude and demeanor towards him was completely different than it was towards me.  It wasn't sexual in the least.  I've seen this countless other times, and see it constantly in bars.  

The only reason I bring this up is because in almost every post to new guys I see someone say, ""Talk to everyone!"".  In all honesty, I think this is a great way to develop bad habits.  Its going to teach you how to engage in boring conversations.

**BUT THAT'S WHY YOU NEED KINO BRO!!!** 

I don't care how much kino you use, if you're listening to her talk about backpacking through Europe you're probably spinning your wheels.  I'd also be willing to bet every time kino goes creepy, its because you're touching her while talking about the stock market.  
 
It gives rise to openers that no one gives a shit about, such as the ""what's your new years resolution?"" one which was introduced in another thread.  Unless you follow up with, ""my resolution is to put my penis in your mouth,"" you're going to be costing yourself more ass than you're getting. 

How many posts go up daily about guys who get ""friend-zoned""?  Chances are, if they hadn't tried to appear too cool for school, they'd have known where they stood the whole time.

I'm sure occasionally the long conversation approach works, but overall you're probably squandering situations.

145172,"So, about 4 or 5 months ago, I drove across the country to be with my (now) husband. I drove from Portland, Oregon to a little town in Illinois, just outside St. Louis. 

When I left Portland, it was hard. I love that city a ton, and I always felt attached to it unlike anywhere else I'd lived. (I moved around a lot as a kid. We finally settled in Portland in seventh grade.) But I was on the cusp of homelessness/joblessness, and the rent was too damn high. Still, I loved my city to death, and it was hard to leave it. 

So, when I finally realised that I wouldn't be able to survive there anymore, I packed my things into my tiny 1984 Volvo, and drove to Illinois over the course of three days. 


I'm now living in Illinois with my loving husband and I have a job that I actually really love. I'm living comfortably (for the most part) and I know that I did the right thing in moving here. But I still feel terribly homesick. 

I have no friends or family here, aside from my husband. I've tried making friends, but I don't really get along with a lot of the people here. Its hard to find female friends that have the same interests as I do, or that don't think I'm a total weirdo. (I read comics and own two rats. I might as well be an alien to the girls I've met.) 

And, what makes it worse, is that I see reminders of Portland all over reddit. I spend a lot of my time on reddit, if I'm not gaming, and I do love it. But it seems there are a lot of Portlanders that frequent this site. (The Portland subreddit has 2,000+ redditors. St. Louis just has a few hundred.) But every time I see someone mentioning that they are from portland, its like a smack to the face, and I have to exit the page to try and forget about it, because it hurts *that* bad, remembering all my friends, family, precious food carts, and uniqueness that I left behind in portland. 

My husband and I are saving up to visit portland, and we were supposed to make it during christmas. But, as you can see, that didn't work out. Its going to be very hard this year to spend the holidays without my family. I'll likely be working. (My husband hates Christmas. So he's not big on celebrating it.)

On top of that, my cousin is getting married in Febuary, and we're trying desperatly to save up money to get there. I've been taking on overtime, and we've cut our eating habits back a bit, as well as other frivolities. However, there is a LOT of work my car needs done. (New tires, new alignment, new belts, breaks, ect...) And I'm worried that we'll have to spend the savings on my car, and miss my cousin's wedding. If thats the case, we won't be able to go until next fall, because in the spring and summer I'm taking classes at the community college, and during my break between spring/summer I'm visiting my dad whom I haven't seen in three years. 

Waiting that long to go home would kill me. I'm already starting to feel depressed and terribly homesick as it is. And its only been five months. 


This was more of a rant/ramble than anything else, but any encouraging words or suggestions you can share on the matter would be greatly appreciated. 

**TL;DR** Moved away from Portland, OR a few months ago to Illinois. Incredibly homesick, and don't know how to deal with it.

1. All explosives are always unstable.  
2. Never point your explosive at anything you are not willing to destroy.  
3. Keep your finger off the detonator until you are prepared to detonate.  
4. Be sure of your target and the radius of the explosion.  

Perhaps these rules could have done the D'Autremont brothers some good when they attempted to rob a postal train back in 1923.

145743,"I have had a taxing year to say the least. I quit my job in June because of back problems that the doctors had not been able to do anything about. At the time I was 7,000 dollars behind on my mortgage because my room-mate and fiance both moved out the previous november(over a year ago) leaving me to pay for a house on my income alone which I could barely afford things when we were all splitting things three ways.

 A family member loaned/gave me $5,000 to pay of my delinquent mortgage payments, but since I didn't have the full amount the mortgage company wouldn't take a partial payment because I was in foreclosure. I stopped that and have been trying to get a modification but in June I quit my job and decided my only shot was to use the money I was borrowed and start a company doing the profession I had been working in for 10 years. Things looked good at first until I landed a couple of big job and had to invest some capitol. What I was afraid of happening happened. Three accounts just decided not to pay(over 10,000 dollars of payments total) and even if I took them to court I wouldn't see the money until long after I am kicked out of my house. My family doesn't come around or call and I know they care but I just don't feel the emotional attachment to them I think a normal person would. 

This month my student loans will no longer be able to be deferred and that is basically going to seal the nail in the coffin for me. I can't even sell my house without losing money and have been a wreck about the whole thing for almost a year now. I am now to the point that I don't care about much anymore. I am on unemployment and am literally starving just so that I can keep the lights and heat on in my house. The only other thing I pay for is the internet because if I didn't have it I'd have nobody to talk to. I can barely even drive my car anywhere because my tags expired in july and I have no way to pay the $200 to get new ones. My insurance just got dropped to for failure to pay so there is also that. I just don't know what to even say to my family about how I can't even afford to pay for gas to come visit over Christmas let alone get my car street legal(which I don't even worry about anymore).

I'm just done. I want the relief of not feeling any of this anymore. I can't even sleep at night because of the horrible anxiety that my dreams cause me. I go to a psychiatrist but I don't think it is helping and it is the only one I can afford($50 every three months, I dont have insurance).

This shit makes my blood boil. Apparently, over night, my simple little comment was dowvoted into oblivion and people made all sorts of ridiculous anti-gun statements towards me. Most, if not all, obviously foreigners, some even stating as such.

I checked this morning and it was hovering around 40 upvotes, but when I saw all of the comments, my mental shit hit the fan. I responded to pretty much every single one, and by the time I was done, I was pretty upset.

How do these people manage to defend their sentiments? Most of them will even admit that they're from countries who have banned guns, and thus they have *zero* understanding of them. How can someone with zero understanding of a topic comment on it at all? You don't see my ass making comments on threads about astrophysics, and that's because I *don't know shit about it*. Why are guns magically ""on-limits"" to people who know nothing about them?

Ugh.

On the one hand, I'm not entirely unsympathetic to the attitude behind the argument, but on the other, certain elements of the article really pissed me off. This paragraph, for instance:

&gt;Since its inception in 1996, the Book Club has carved its niche among readers by telling them that the novel is a chance to learn more about themselves. It’s not about literature or writing; it’s about looking into a mirror and deciding what type of person you are, and how you can be better. While a generally wrongheaded view of novels, this notion is all the more frustrating when the club delves into the true classics, with their vast knottiness, glorious language, breathtaking characters, and multi-faceted, mind-twisting prose. None of that matters in Oprah’s view of books, since reading is yet another exercise in self-gratification. “If you have read him, what do you think Dickens might have to share and teach those of us who live in this digital age?” the Book Club’s producer, Jill, asks on Oprah’s website. This is the Eat, Pray, Love school of reading. 

It seems to me that Kelly is here profoundly ignorant of modern literary criticism's roots in the liberal humanism of the late 19th century, which asked *precisely* these types of questions, and furthermore there is a distinct tone of condescension and elitism throughout that I think is entirely counterproductive to getting people back on board with reading the classics.

Which Oprah is doing. Sure, maybe not everybody's going to *get* it right off the bat, but maybe somebody will who wouldn't otherwise have ever read Dickens, and are we really going to denigrate anything or anyone who facilitates that?

However, consider this: Person of the Year hasn't meant anything for years now. Originally, as I'm sure you all know, Man (later Person) of the Year was given to whoever was the biggest newsmaker in that year. In 1938, Adolf Hitler was undoubtedly the biggest newsmaker, therefore he was Man of the Year for 1938. The following year, it was Josef Stalin, the second time the Man of Steel got that title. So it obviously wasn't a necessarily positive thing. By this logic, Assange should have gotten it.

That changed in 2001. The biggest story of that year was undoubtedly the 9/11 attacks. The biggest newsmaker, one would think, would be Osama bin Laden, and thus he would be named Man of the Year. However, this was not the case, as the title went to Rudy Giuliani (a sense of ""patriotism"" and plain sensitivity about these things may have had a hand in the decision, I think). With that, Person of the Year became a positive thing, another award, which led to such idiotic winners as ""You"" in 2006.

that lasted for a while, but soon people started drifting off again.
so Lasoaj told me about his plan to recreate a tribe, with his list of 18 people that were really active, talkative and nice, i agreed to it and came up with a name (Mercury) and opened it up making him the only spirit chief, because he suggested it. when i went to sleep(I'm on europe time) he hadn't talked to the others yet and we only invited 1 more person.
this morning i signed on and noticed that Lasoaj opened up another tribe. i asked him what was up and he answered that he opened up a solo tribe. i just accepted it, even though i was pretty pissed that he left Mercury without leaving a spirit chief, ruining that tribe.
 
When i came home from class and signed on I noticed Mandolin on and she was in that tribe. I asked what's up, she said she forced andy into taking her into the tribe, jokingly about it.

Well 2 hours ago i signed on and noticed 2 more people were in that tribe. i confronted one of them and first they didn't say anything. shortly after Lasoaj signed on - i was still messaging on of those 2.
i asked why the fuck doesn't laso just tell me that why he didnt want me in the tribe. i got asked what i did to Mandolin.
I was confused. o.o 
So here's what happened. Apparently i said something that upset Mandolin. If i did i definitely didnt mean to and she should know that.
She got pissed, but instead of showing me, she kept her nice facade towards me. She told everyone that i upset her though and convniced them that they didn't want me in the new tribe. good thing that i just found out 30 minutes ago that she was upset huh. couldn't be mature about it o.o

I lost interest in the game few weeks ago and just bootcampd with some of them to kill time (silly of me to think of them as friends)
Now that i got backstabbed by her i'm 500 cheese short and lost most of my tfm friends there's nothing holding me on that site - so i'm parting with the tfm community. 

goodbye, sorry that you had to endure me rant, it's not my style, but that spineless act of Mandolin seriously pissed me off, also that all of those people sheeped behind her, not informing me either.",-1,-1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Almost all the participants successfully completed the month (one gave in to a meatball sub on something like the third day) and it was a great time.  I felt great by the end and managed to drop a few pounds, all while trying lots of new foods and learning how to cook new dishes.

I work for an electronics retail store and have for a few years now so the stress of holidays is nothing new. Today was definitely a first for me. We had a customer come into my store asking to purchase a kindle. One of my employees nicely explained to him that we were currently out of stock and he seemed pretty upset so she asked for an MOD to come speak with him. unfortunately, I was the first person to respond to the page. I greeted the customer and he was perfectly pleasant at first. He asked why were out of stock of something we advertise and how he could get it. I explained how they were a very popular item for the season and even checked other locations for him to pick it up at. During our conversation he started to ask about other e-readers so i gave him a demo of the Nook, explaining everything he asked about and comparing it to the kindle. I offered to drop the price of the Nook to match the Kindle for the inconvenience, which he seemed happy with and decided to go ahead and purchase it for his wife.
 At the moment i lean down to pick the nook up he whispers to me in an angry voice "" One of these days I'm going to come in and shoot all you mother fuckers with a machine gun!"" 
I immediately stand up and tell him to get out of my store and never ever come back. He says "" If you dumbasses would just carry what you advertise I wouldn't have to do that would i? Fuck off."" and storms out of the door...........

152957,"I'm wondering about advice, help, words, jokes, ideas, philosophies, riddles, puns or anything else that you might contribute to me and others who are also suffering.

I feel like I've lost some of my autonomy.

It's a long story, but the short version is:
1. I have had digestive troubles for over ten years now, I've never been very passionate about resolving this with doctors, though I am trying a homeopathic thing right now, but I know it just comes down to diet, exercise and stress... essentially day-to-day living and lifestyle.

2. I've always been intellectual and emotional, and have developed ways to think and learn from my suffering (thanks Buddhism)
unfortunately I still get stressed out sometimes...

3. I had a very important relationship almost exactly 2 years ago,
I have very fond and happy memories, but these reminiscings also have a negative effect, in that they cause real physical strain on my heart and strain on my perspective.

4. I currently work 5 days a week 4 hours a day. This is mostly due to me not being able to be reliable enough to have full-time hours, I have to be around a washroom a lot and some days I need to stay home due to either wanting to be around my own bathroom all day (yes pooping and cramps), and/or because my mood is shit and I'm exhausted because I'm not digesting food properly.  Thankfully, my job is pretty understanding towards my condition. 

6. I currently have quit smoking cigarettes after being addicted for over 10 years. (yeah! finally a gleam of victory :D ... gleam?)

7. I make enough money to pay my half of the rent and buy a bit of food each month to get by.

8. I need to create; I produce music, I draw cartoons, do digital art, jam ideas, write poetry.

9. I need to explore words and ideas; history, anthropology, spirituality, humanity, reality, science, alchemy, philosophy, technology, the seen and unseen, to find the bridge to the middle ground and perceive through multiple stories of multiple experiences and empathize with humans and their struggles and triumphs.

10. I don't have money to buy my parents or my sister anything, I am of course doing what I usually do and that's bringing data home for Christmas.  X-mas movies, x-mas songs (gotta burn bonny-m every year :), I usually have a few new songs from me for them.  I know that they don't mind, and that they are just happy to have me home for Christmas, but I feel like I wish I could provide...
anyway..
I guess my point is, I am having some difficult times during the holidays, I'm sure many of you know that not only can this season be stressful, but it amplifies when you are dealing with a not so perfect existence and you are trying to feel your way out of it.

I am looking forward to the new year.
I am thinking about going on social assistance, getting a social worker, asking them if I can get supplementary income to eat real food, pay my bills, get me stable, so my moods are good, so I can pick up more full-time work.  

any thoughts?

153301,"Background: My girlfriend and I have been dating for just over 18 months and we have been truley in love (and to an extent I still feel like I love her just as much as I used to) for a large portion of that time. It's just a lot of the time I feel that she's not actually the 'right' girl. I can't put my finger on why it is. I think a substantial part of that feeling is due to the fact that she's quite a simple person and maybe that's just not what I'm after? (Although she is my first serious girlfriend, hence why I am unsure)

Basically, when we were first getting to know each other, I was perplexed for the first few months because it seemed I was hardly getting to know her to any greater extent than I did in the first few weeks after meeting. I was puzzled, but then it hit me that there was actually *nothing else to know about her*. It sounds harsh I know but it's quite true, and hey I'm not holding that against her at all, she's just relatively simple, and maybe I'm after a 'challenge' or something?

Currently we're on summer break and living about 1000km apart, and I'm now at the point where my texts and calls have become sparse (completely from my end - she's still as keen as beans). She knows this and has been asking questions - even asking if I'm going to break up with her. The truth is, I *don't* want to break up with her, because I love her, but at the same time I can definitely feel something is not quite there and I'm almost certain my future doesn't lie with this girl (I was previously convinced it would). 

I just need some kind of advice or help. I don't really know what I'm feeling. When she asked me if I was going to break up with her there was some asshole cutting onions right next to me...

154994,"My best friend is Alex. Alex is gay. I struggle to find out why I always say that first because it doesn't really have anything to do with the kind of person he is. Imagine saying you have a BMW, and then being compelled to always say, the trunk lining is blue, instead of describing its year, make, color, or model. Alex is a 1985, slender, white, “nicest guy in the world”. I'll spare any further introductions because you've already met me and my friend Alex. We are just those two guys you see hanging out at the movies but the seat between us, the ""gay buffer"", is an inside joke.

When we were both 17 Alex told me his secret, and when we were both 22 he told his parents his secret. Shortly after he showed up, unannounced, at my doorstep, broken, to tell me his story. My mind couldn't help but drift a little while he got it all out. 

I rewound nearly 10 years. My brother had been drinking, he was 16, and he was delivered, nearly unconscious, to my parents front door covered in party-sauce that his body decided it didn't want. My parents tended to him as if it were just the flu, but by morning when soberness came so too did all out battle. Both sides no doubt having a to-arms speech in their mind where some figure urged them to battle and gave confidence to their position that they, not the other, were to be in control of this 16 year olds life. 

I sat quietly in my room and did whatever it was that a geeky 13 year old did in 1998, but my main motive was to listen to my family cry war. I now don't remember much of what was said but I can still recall my father telling Arron, my brother that if he didn't like the house rules he could leave. Arron wasn't a bad person; he was just trying to be himself. He is still, at 28, the same guy that goes out and has way too much to drink. He also still, though he owns his own home, basically still lives with my parents. I can always count on him already being there if I need to stop by for something. I know that if anything ever happens to my parents as they age that my brother will be there, hopefully sober.

I also had my problems, but they may seem less severe. Beyond Alex, I had no friends. I sometimes felt like we, Alex and I, clicked, not because we were compatible, but because we were too scared to try to fit in, or didn't want too. I, later in high school, began skipping classes. I, later in high school, like Arron, also had battles with our parents. I was never told that the rules were the rules and if I didn't like it I could move out. My parents yelled, and blew up in the same way they did with Arron, but at the end of the day they gave me a long leash, and helped me eventually find a small school I could transfer to where I felt like I fit in. 

I day dreamed through Alex's sobs, and I remember always feeling like Arron had softened my parents up. As if my truancy was small potatoes in the light of my brothers binge drinking. As if, who cares if the younger one stays out till 2 AM watching classic movies when the older one is out till 4 AM drinking.

I'm ignoring Alex. I'm only hearing half of what he is saying. He says his parents said they will never have grandchildren, but then I see my brother getting physical with my dad and being pinned to a chair to stop the flailing of his fists. I feel the sting at the side of my face when I said something only an angsty 17 year old would say to his mother, and she momentarily lost control of her right hand. I can hear my father yelling. I can hear doors slamming.

Alex has gotten to the point where I can’t understand him and he has to stop talking to breath. I hug him and have one final flash back. I'm 18, I haven't graduated yet, but I'm close. I've done something stupid, I can't remember what. My teenage memories are two separate chains of stupid things I've done and arguments I've had as a result. Which argument goes with which stupid act I couldn't say. This particular argument doesn't go as anticipated. My dad sits, as opposed to standing over me. He's quiet, almost not there, as I am with Alex right now. For several minutes he isn't making sense but finally gets to the point. 

“We've always told your brother that if he didn't like our rules he could just find another place to live. I've never once made that offer to you. Do you know why?”

“No...”

“Because your mother and I both knew you would leave. Your brother needs us, and we know you don't.”

At 18 I felt an immense amount of pride and validation hearing that. I was independent all along and hadn't had anything to prove. I proved it all when I was 9 and packed a bag to run away. I love my parents, but I don't need them. I choose to be with them because they are my friends. The point of this information had always escaped me until now, holding Alex, trying desperately to stop daydreaming and listen to him.

I break my grasp; push his shoulders back so I can see his face. I finally break my silence and tell him one word.

Leave.

My daughter Amy made it out alive my love did not , she never got to know her daughter, I went home and cried for about 3 months nonstop , tried to be a good father , my parents helped a lot I had no idea how to take care of me and my daughter. I kept going into work by I distanced myself from everyone including my friends; I just didn’t know what to say.
Her parents have never helped us they blame me and our child for killing their daughter, I wasn’t even allowed to go to her funeral, they even stopped me on the day from entering the church i sat in the car with my daughter crying. I talk to my fiancé every day I know she’s not there but it makes me feel better.

I still don’t know what to do, I know I’m not an attractive prospect for women now I have a daughter and her mother is dead, I’m not very well off. I struggle even to buy things day to day my Dad gives me money but I could hardly even take a woman out on a date.

My question how can I get over this and move on?
Update:

Thanks for the advice I don't really know how i'm going to have christmas this year, I think I will have 2 days off but I really needthe money so my parents have offered to take Amy for the day. I just miss having people to talk to its odd my daily routine is wake up at 5am go to work til 5:30, get a train , then a bus to my house. Drive to my parents from there pick amy up ,drive home . Eat a meal go to bed. On the weekends I normally wake up at 6 go to bed when amy falls asleep , it is not really a life but its the only onw I have now and I have to live for my daughter now and keep going.

Christmas will be terrible this year as it was last year, going to put some flowers on J grave then go back to work, I saved up some money to buy some I will feel guility about that too I suppose , that they are not good enough.

My friend was caught in a sting operation. The narc told cops it was MDMA, I assume. The field test was positive for MDMA. But it's not MDMA. My friend never claimed it was MDMA when setting things up with the narc (although the narc kept insisting on 'that molly') or when being questioned-he didn't say shit. It's pure mephedrone, this is a fact. I've read that field tests will do this.

He is looking at two counts of felony distribution for two occurrences. 

I've suggested he have his lawyer get a sample tested, to prove it's not MDMA, and try to negotiate charges down to  intent to distribute a counterfeit.   

This happened in Virginia, where mephedrone is unscheduled. It is being handled by county police, thus they are not invoking the Federal Analogue Statute. The police don't know that it's mephedrone, they think it's MDMA/molly. 

My friend hasn't said shit to the cops. He has some priors though.

I have absolutely no experience with microcontrollers, and I was interested in creating an automated nerf sentry turret (basically a fully automatic nerf gun mounted on two moving servo motors that tracks movement). The microcontroller will ideally be operated via USB (The motion tracking device will feed into the laptop, which will process the input and transmit instructions to the gun), and will control the firing mechanism (basically just a 0 or 1 current over a wire, from what I can tell), and the rotation of both servo motors.

Do you suggest any brand or model of microcontroller or a specific approach to this task? Sorry for being a newb, and thanks so much for your help!

155696,"Dear Reddit.com,

I'm going to be turning 25 in a couple of weeks and I have been reflecting on my childhood life...
When I was around 3 or 4, my Mom and Dad had already divorced and my sister and I were living with our father, the pastor. One day, we got picked up from our school by the police and were taken to the police station where we waited for our Mom. Our Dad had apparently been charged with lewd lascivious acts and sexual battery of an underage boy.

Me and my sister lived with our Mother, who hopped around from guy to guy (6 marriages, 5 guys) in an effort to ""provide"" for us, until we both came to our senses, realized our Mom was crazy and moved out when we were 17.

About a year ago, I had found out that through my sister that our father had gotten out of jail, she sent me a link to his ""sexual offender"" flyer. It provided his address, as required by law, and I decided to send him a letter. Ya know the angry letter you're suppose to write and not send? Well, I sent it.

To my surprise, my hateful letter was responded to with a message of love and regret.

I recently spent some time with my Mother during Thanksgiving and at one point we had a bit of a heated argument (as family members do) where she said something about how I was ""just like him.""

For one, this disturbed me. And secondly, it made me think that I should probably write him a response letter only I have no idea what to say. A friend of mine suggested that I meet with him in person, and that meeting with his real father (he was adopted) really helped him.

I'm kinda stuck on the fence, I mean, I want to see my Father before he dies, but I don't know how I can forgive and then forget him. I think that the forgiveness might just spark a reconciliation that I don't want.

Any thoughts?",-1,-1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Now that sounds awful bitter, and it is, so why bother? That's an easy one.

Worse, they'll stack the cards against the neophyte and undermine him at every possible juncture, all to preserve a narrative. As the economy recovers under enemy rule, that great Vitirol Dynamo will sputter and falter, and its ratings will plummet and its clout will vanish. Its Hail Mary tactic is to just keep spinning in spite. Its prerogative is to keep the economy from recovering, and force-feeding the economy misinformation that it is not recovering seems to do the [trick](http://www.alternet.org/story/149193/study_confirms_that_fox_news_makes_you_stupid/null).

A habit will bear its addiction. It's all too simple. It's human nature under pressure. And this is the time of the year when it will bear bitter fruit, and now is the worst possible time.

158679,"Hey RA! I've heard you give some great advice in the past, so I come to you with my conundrum. 


I recently entered my first relationship ever. At the ripe old age of 22, I felt like the only thing missing in my life was a relationship. So once I had one, I was over joyed. 

Fast forward two months (the present), the girl and I are headover heels for each other. This isn't her first relationship, and she says ""we're too perfect for each other"". In some ways shes right. I haven't had a relationship, so I don't really know. But we get along really well and solve small arguments very quickly.

So I felt that she was ""the love of my life"" until yesterday. I was talking with some friends and all of a sudden, I felt like fog had been lifted from my brain. I still very much like her, but I am not sure if I like her so much that I see a future (marriage) with her. I know it is way too soon to be even discussing/thinking about that. 
I suggested we slow down a bit, because she was already discussing moving in together. 

She gets a little bit upset, and then says she understands completely and thinks that we should slow down as well. After a few days, nothing has changed. She is still staying at my place and we're just as close as ever. I don't want to get rid of her I have no problems with her staying with me. However I really do want to slow down a bit. I have a feeling if I'm going to really upset her. How can I approach this?

EDIT:: She says she'll probably never find love again etc. if I break up with her. She's been hurt in the past and I feel like I will be betraying her and damaging her permanently if I ever break up with her. I guess I feel a bit trapped.

159379,"My last customer was a German man who was in town contracted to work on a project.  He was having computer issues and needed to have it looked at.  When he was checking it in on Monday I informed him that the estimated turn around time is 2 to 3 business days.  He needs to have it completed by Friday before he leaves back for Germany.  I presented him our rush service that would guarantee that his unit will be completed before then by placing him in front of all the other customers waiting in line.  He doesn't want to pay and I restate the turn around time and add ""could be shorter, could be longer, it is an estimate!""  

Fast forward to Wed and they are calling.  My wife, who is pregnant, had called me complaining of blood pressure issues, she was stuck in the bathroom and couldn't walk, and wanted to go to the ER.  I rush home to take care of that around 1pm.  They called some time after I left, my employee tells then he might get to it and if so will call them back after he performs some diagnostics.  Unfortunately, due to running the store by himself, he's unable to get to it.  

They call back the next morning and want to know what is going on with it.  By now, my employee has gotten it onto his bench and is scanning it for infections (so far about 11 already.)  At some time later he calls them about what is going on with it and how much it will take to fix it.  He approves the price, asks about time, is told it might be 3pm but he could call back in to check.  

He calls at 3:03pm and asks what is going on with the unit.  Unfortunately, my employee has just ran out to the store.  I check his unit and find the scan had completed and that once the tech returned I would have him call.  From then till 5:30pm we were rushed with customers, phone calls, and the demands of fixing our own machines.  My employee forgets to call and they come up to our store.

He starts to complain about the turn around time.  I show him his ticket that he signed.  The paragraph above what he has signed stated that we've informed him that our turn around time was an estimate, due to unforeseen circumstances we are not responsible if it takes longer, and that even the price could increase.

This is when I lost my cool infront of a customer in almost 5 years.  He looked at me and stated, ""You are just doing this because I am German! ...  If I was an American White you'd not be treating me this way!  I bet if I were Mexican or Black you'd treat me the same way!""

I basically told him I was offended that he'd act like that with me.  That, when he checked his computer in we'd discussed that I went to an international college where there were students from all around the world.  That many of the members of the fraternity that I belong to live all over this earth.  

Before they left they even asked for their diag fee back.  I let them know that we called and informed them of the issue.  That they agreed to the repairs and we were half way through with them.  I refused to refund it but might get burned for it later.

How could he think this of me?  I was upfront and honest about my turn around time.  I expressed I felt he needed to rush it.

I had to call the owner about the whole ordeal.  His wife stated she was going to call the BBB and other groups about how bad I handled the situation.  He's probably going to chew me out about this.  I hope it doesn't go further.

UPDATE:  So I just got a call from my old manager who is now our head on-site technician.  He had spoken with the owner who was asking him what to do.  He stated that with Christmas right around the corner, a baby on the way, tight on money, with stress from running a slow store due to the holidays can have on a person.  That I probably had my reason, that yes, I should have just given him his money back and be done with it.  When I speak with the owner tomorrow I'll have to see what happens from there.

UPDATE2:  I've just had a two hour meeting with the owner.  He's accused my co worker and I of failing to do an unrealistic work load.  That we've caused this issue to arise due to a 2-3day turn around time.  That our end numbers don't equate to how many units we take in every day.  That we should be 1 day out like our competition (I called around last time he made this argument... we've got the shortest in town on average.)  We get around 8-12 units a day.  I work on 5-6 a day myself.  Half of them at the moment are declining repairs due to cost alone.  Christmas is right around the corner and they don't want to pay.

Overall, I'm looking for a new job now.  I wasn't fired or anything, I'm just tired of dealing with the public directly.  I'm going to look for a job at a company where I don't have to worry about bottom dollar to keep the business afloat.  I just need to worry if Tammy in sales can get her email.

I get what I need and head back toward the registers just in time to see register 1 opening up and a kid from the line to register 2 (still quite long) heading over to register 1. As the lady rings up his purchases I get in line behind him. 

He pays, heads out, and just as I set my bottle of tea down a woman from the other line walks over and promptly informs me that ""The line is back there."" I kind just gave her a deadpan stare and asked, ""The line for *this* register is back there?"" To which she had no ready response, but another woman from the line turned her chin up and shot me an icy ""Yes."" Not wanting to hold things up or create a scene, I thought fuck it, half-assedly apologized and moved. I had nowhere to be so a few extra minutes waiting wasn't a big deal.

So, was I in the wrong here? I mean I understand that if there's a long line and another register becomes available, the people who are next in line should be helped first. But when this register opened up, nobody got in line aside from the kid and, moments later, me. 

I also found it rather curious that this lady waited until it was my turn before walking over and shooing me to the back of the long line. I think she and this other woman were just tired of waiting. Looking back though I probably should have just asked the checkout lady.

A week or so before Halloween I decided I wanted it and started tracking down someone who could claim ownership over the studio, and by extension the picture.  I looked up the business on google and tried to call the listed number, but it was disconnected.  So I called the city and tried to find out who owned the building.  It turns out the man who owned the studio and took the picture had died recently.  I was given the number to someone who owned a business in the building next door to the studio.  I spoke to them a few times and got the number to the current owner of the property.  I called that number several times, and no one ever picked up no matter how long it rang.

I hope by hosting this I can help shed some light on a topic which is highly feared and poorly understood. I obviously don't want to reveal my identity, hence this new reddit account, so I'll need to be vague about some details, but I'll try to be as honest as possible. I'll also edit this post and add any questions which are asked repeatedly. AMA

EDIT: phew, quite a response. I'll try to answer the questions in the order which they were asked. Also edited this post slightly to include the ages I'm attracted to.

FAQS:

1: were you abused or neglected as a child?

No. My father and I were never very close, but that's about it.


2: are you attracted to children physically or emotionally?

Both.


3: you need help, are you in/have you had therapy? etc.

I have been through a lot of assorted psychologists, counselors, doctors and such, but you can't change what someone is biologically attracted to. Also, there is no treatment available specifically for someone who experiences an attraction to minors but hasn't acted on it.

She's about a year after a divorce and has two teenage kids and a working mom.

164086,"Dear redditors, I need your help and I need it desperately. Here's why:

A couple of days ago [I explained the drastic turn of events](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/em55g/i_did_a_grave_mistake_in_the_recent_past_and_now/) in my relationship with my lovely, lovely, lovely girlfriend.

I did a mistake, or rather I was about to. But I realized just in time that I was about make one and how horny and irresponsible I am. So I decided not to do it. But apparently, not making a mistake is not a success by itself. 

As you can guess, (if you clicked the link above and read that one, of course) she decided that it was a pretty failure in my own part and  called it quits. I tried to explain how it was almost like porn and how it was a silly thing and how stupid I was and how we don't have any strip clubs here and I admitted my guilt and told her how much I love her and how I only desire her and how, oh how I don't need anybody else but only her. But as you may know, in the moment of crisis and cries and shoutings, most of the words spoken go unheard and feelings unattended or unheeded, as anger masters over everything. As a result of this (or being really pissed off about my excuse on stripclubs) she didn't take a step back and has left my emails, text messages (even Last FM messages -see how desperate I am?-) unanswered to this moment. 

For me, it just started to sink and I feel like I just swallowed a giant murlock trying to make its way out of my stomach. It hurts, it hurts like the fist of an angry god, and feels like the first day one starts high school; weird, empty and full of braces. I can't eat, talk to anyone about it and I'm feeling like I'm just a slave-man in borderworld Xen who's about to make a choice between two bad alternatives, plus I don't have a crowbar, if I had, I would crash crates and feel a bit relieved. Though I do sleep, it's not restful. It feels awkward and sad waking to a world without her. 

I hope I did explain myself, even a bit. For now, I can't do much but wait. Elders say that time heals everything and I should wait for her decision but I'm afraid that her decision is final. But I know how awesome reddit is, (you even started a fucking rally!) how awesome _you_ are and I ask of you this: 

* Please take a picture of yourself holding a sign with the words ""He's sorry"" or ""he's a good guy actually"" ""He loves you"" or ""he's almost OK"" anthing funny, lovely you can think of that will help me in this quest. 

* Post it here as a comment and that's it.

Hopefully, I'll show this page to her and we'll be together again or better; she may even become a redditor, too!

Please don't say my princess is in another castle. :(

164224,"Reddit I apologise in advance for this absolutely pathetic diatribe, I understand if you don’t read it. 

I recently moved to a new city for college, I don’t really know anyone, I have been at college for a year but I have not made any friends, I live by myself and have no job, my days are spent browsing reddit, sleeping or playing video games, I have no motivation for study and am only just scraping through using the absolute bare minimum of effort needed. I can feel myself spiralling towards depression, I’m not suicidal or anything like that but I can definitely feel myself being pulled deeper and deeper into a hole that will just become harder to break free from. The loneliness is absolutely crippling, I can go days without speaking to anyone, this is coming from someone who has always valued large amounts of alone time and I feel absolutely pathetic for needing social interaction this badly as it has never been something I’ve valued all that highly.

The thing is I am not that socially awkward, I can handle day to day interactions just fine and hold a conversation reasonably well, I am also reasonably pretty, I just don’t know how to make friends, the relationships just aren’t developing and I know it’s because I don’t put myself out there, if I am not the one being approached I will simply not talk to anyone.

I am unable to pull away from my comfort zones, I don’t approach people because I’m terrified of making a fool out of myself, or that I’ll look pathetic, I am constantly lying to people about myself, like if people ask what my living arrangements are I’ll lie and say I’m living with some friends, or give a vague answer about the area and hope they don’t pry further, if people ask what I did on the weekend I’ll give a vague answer about going out drinking, when in reality I would have been spent the entire time in front of a computer. I don’t let people become to involved with my life because I’m afraid they’ll think I’m a weird, pathetic, lonely person who’s been living here for a year but still has absolutely no friends, I’m so desperate to maintain my façade of being a well adjusted, normal individual and that itself is a big barrier in being able to change myself to fit the face I’m projecting.

I’ve had plans for awhile about how I could go about changing things, the usual join a gym, club or volunteer but I always rationalise out some excuse not to, like exams are coming up, or Christmas or something stupid like that, I’ve considered moving in with some randoms but I rationalise that away because I still have a few more months left on my lease which I can’t break, and again I don’t want to explain why I was previously living by myself.

I’m unable to leave my comfort zones, I know nothing will ever change if I don’t, I know there’s no point in sticking to old routines if they don’t accomplish anything, and that my choice is either do nothing or make some change and accept that I’m very likely going to make a dick out of myself a good amount of the time but if I don’t nothing will change, but I can just never convince myself to make that leap and I’m terrified that I’m wasting what should be the best years of my life.

And beneath all this I desperately want to be that spontaneous and adventurous person (to be like that guy who is just up and leaving to travel the states and meet redditors), a person who isn’t constantly rationalising things away and preventing myself from living. 

I’m not really sure what I hope to accomplish by posting this, I know the leap has to be made by me, I’ve read all the best motivational speeches reddit has to offer and I always get excited about what I’m going to do to change things, in the morning… Anyway it’s given me something to do as I spend another Friday night alone.

164294,"Lots of useless back story: About two years ago I adopted a six week old puppy that was thrown in the trash outside a convenience store. I loved that little guy, and thought I did an OK job raising him. To get ready I read multiple books, took him to classes, etc...., but he would still jump up on people, bark at the doorbell, and become overly aggressive with his kisses. He was a good dog, just not the best manors.

So after my girlfriend left, she took the dog with her. There was a massive hole in my heart, and I still looked for him every time I came home. To avoid filling the void with some random dog, I promised myself I would take my time. I've spent the six months looking for a dog, and its taken a whole lot of patience not to adopt every dog I've met just because they're cute. I finally found one with a personality I love, but she's only six months old. I swore I wouldn't adopt a puppy again, but she's very well behaved, loves attention, and is a lazy bag of bones when someone is petting her. In short, I fell in love with [this little lady](http://i.imgur.com/JlwPH.jpg). She was everything I was looking for, so I wouldn't let her become euthanized just because she was young.

I asked Reddit for [help with a name](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ekrba/i_need_help_naming_this_little_lady_what_would/), and I think I've settled on Penny, but maybe I like Madeline more, or.... - I don't know. I really am still having trouble with this part. She's a passive dog and I love movies. Any ideas?

Anyway, the real question I wanted to ask /r/pets is if they have any tips for raising puppies. I want to make sure this girl stays who she is, and I don't want to ruin her because I think I'm trying to be stern with her raising. I've always been bad with punishing a dog - I just don't know how to. I would give a 'No', followed by petting after they stopped. Is there a timeout method you guys use? What do you do for encouragement?

I was thinking about my own personal issues and thought this might be a healthy forum for discussion. **No man is an island, so whatever it is, get it off your chest!**

I've always had problems with weight, or specifically *lack* thereof. I wasn't anorexic, I was just horribly lazy. In high school I'd sleep through first period, roll out of bed and go straight to 2nd period without breakfast. Skip lunch to do the homework that I blew off the night before, then come home and nap without eating, so I could stay up late to play video games. I'd wake up, have a quick dinner and that would be the only food for me all day. Ultimately, I graduated high school at 6'1"" tall weighing, generously, 120 pounds.

Not much changed in college, my terrible eating habits continued but I got horribly self conscious about my skinniness. Started wearing layers and layers of clothing to try to hide it. Even in the 90 degree heat of summer I'd wear long pants and long sleeves, afraid to show my complete lack of buttocks and biceps. I graduated college around 128 pounds.

About that time I had a moment of clarity, or terror, that made me change my habits. I was on my way out of a movie theater when a gigantic jacked guy grabbed me by the shoulder and spun me around. Right in my face: ""You bumped into my woman; apologize."" I was completely sure he had mistaken me, but I was fucking terrified at his size and the fact that he was basically crushing my shoulder. I caved like a bitch and apologized, and the next day started working out and buying protein mix.

Fastforward to now, I'm still slim at 165 pounds but I'm just starting to get comfortable in my own body. I can rep 185lbs 7-8 times on the bench press which I think, for my weight, is pretty damn good. Especially considering I started benching with just the bar...

I'm still plenty insecure. Despite my friends and family telling me I'm in good shape, I want to gain more weight. My girlfriend recently mentioned how being with me makes her feel like she needs to start running because I'm so skinny. I think she meant it as a compliment, but hearing that word ""skinny"" made me furious inside. My dad tells me there will come a day when I *wish* I were 165 pounds, which only pisses me off. Whenever I go out I'm always conscious of anyone bigger than me, it brings up my insecurities and I purposely avoid their vicinity if possible.

I think if I hit 180 pounds I'll be satisfied. I hope.

When they play top level talent like Washington, Pit, Philly etc., they bring their A game. They're 4-2 against those teams. If you play that well against the big teams, you shouldn't be losing to Buffalo, Ottawa, Toronto, Carolina and so on. The B's consistently play down to lesser competition.

It seems almost every other game I watch the B's and think ""Wow, they look slow"" and then listen as Jack and Brick have the inevitable discussion about how long it took the boys to find their legs. What, they're not trying hard enough? If the team is having trouble getting motivated, it's the coaches job to get pissed, throw some shit around and start laying down the law.

Negativity.  Whether it be from others or from ourselves, negativity can disrupt the progress that you have made for yourself.  In my case, I have a roommate that while supportive at face value, seems jealous of my lifestyle change.  You must be thick skinned in situations such as these.  When a person decides to lose weight or gain muscle, it doesn't go without notice amonst friends and family.  And while it would be ideal for everyone to be supportive, there is a great possibility that you will come across someone that is the opposite.  Actions can speak louder than words.  And having friends that try to continually convince you to eat something you shouldnt or go out drinking instead of working out can be counterproductive.  Of course we all have days where we want to relax.  As you should.  But be wary of patterns that start to rear their heads.  I'm going to take a [direct quote](http://www.suite101.com/content/negative-comments-can-disrupt-weight-loss-programs-a300199) :

**""For many people who have decided to control their weight in a healthy way, this aspect is a hurdle often more difficult to manage than the new food choices to be made. The dieter can start to feel the group is not as friendly or welcoming… perhaps acting differently in some subtle way.**

**When those in a group generally share the same issues, such as being overweight, they feel a sense of acceptance. They ease any apprehension they may have about their health and wellness by reminding themselves they are not alone with this issue. However, when one or two in a group change the status quo, then the rest feel anxious and reminded that their behaviors too need changing. People may feel envious of the dieter’s new empowerment and determination and often there are feelings of jealousy.""**

In short, be aware of what is going on around you.  Resilience is key.  Be strong!  We are in this together and it is not without hurdles.

166689,"My friend (let's call her Jane) is adopted, she was adopted when she was around four-years-old. Jane came from South America to the USA. Her adopted father would do things she did not approve of and made her watch adult movies between the ages of eight and 11. She is now 19. She has told counselors at high school, and stuff like that. She had a recording of her dad confessing that he did it because his father would rape his sisters. Jane confronted her mother about it and gave her the recording. Her mom was in denial and destroyed the evidence. One night Jane's mom drunk dialed Jane, and confessed that she was only with her father for the money to get through tough times, and that she is sorry she couldn't help. 

When Jane talked to her high school counselor, the county began an investigation. After a while, they finally visited her father, and gave him a lie-detector test. He passed it, and the county dropped it since Jane had no real evidence. Her only sibling takes the parents side. Her brother is afraid of what will happen to their father if he admits that their father really did things in the past.

Jane was recently kicked-out of her home because she has been very short tempered, and things would easily trigger her memories of her father. Basically she snapped if the dad looked at her wrong. Her parents knew she was at risk, and are afraid that she might tell someone that will put her father away. So they decided to kick her out. She now stays with some friends, and is currently working two jobs trying to go to college.

She has tried to go to family friends, but as of Thanksgiving, her parents have already talked to everyone of their close friends. They have basically told them that Jane was traumatized when she was younger, before she was adopted, and that she blames her father for things he didn't do. She feels very hopeless and hates that her father is getting away with no consequences. 

What can we do? Who should we talk to? I'm thinking a Social worker might work, but Jane is afraid that they won't believe her because of the lack of evidence. She was very upset that the County didn't give her a lie-detector test, and only her father.

Since she is adopted, she doesn't have any real family to go to, except her brother. He is her biological brother, and they were adopted at the same time. They used to be close, but he sees her as a threat to the family, like she's trying to tear them apart. He doesn't trust her at all, and they no longer get along.

**TL;DR:** Friend was molested when she was a child, parents are trying very hard to cover everything up. She has no real family to go to. We need to know who we can talk to, who we can trust, and we have no evidence/proof.

Due to a few unsettling incidents when I was a teen, I no longer attempt to cultivate friendships with gay men. I still love my gay relatives, because I pretty much have to, but 'gay friends' basically registers in my brain as 'unnecessary risk' at this point.

I am trying to get a handle on programming my own algorithms with javascript.  I thought that I might try my hand at Sudoku.

It ""works"" in that it will generate the board but it is inefficient at best.  

I then thought that maybe there should be a pool of numbers to choose from (rather than generating random numbers, which will undoubtedly generate a lot of the same random numbers repeatedly).  This seems to work, but still isn't ideal.

My family comes back from my graduation from Air Force BMT, right after Thanksgiving, and was welcomed by 3"" of sewage in the basement. My family was not the only house hold to get hit. A total of 3 homes were hit because of blockage in the sewage line. Our home, the home next to us and one down the street. 
The city came by and used a high pressure hose to unclog the sewage pipe and inadvertently did more damage to the house down the street. Because they brought on more damage to the house down the street the city will handle the disaster clean up bill. Meaning our house will not be covered along with the home next to us because it was damage only by the blockage. Anything that was in touch with the sewage was going to be thrown out. The sad part is that the basement is our storage room. From novelty items from trips to priceless wedding photos are gone. Back then in the 1st week of clean up, we were pretty devastated but were unstressed because we thought the city would cover us as well. Which is nice because the bill is well over $10k which doesn't include all of our priceless possession that I would say the grand total near $20k. We have taken off work to get things straighten out and with my mom who is on disability, income is harder than ever. We were just found out because it was a ""natural"" cause of a blockage in the sewer. They will not be covering our bill nor the home next to us.

After playing MineCraft for a mere 1 or 2 minutes I experience an extreme lag spike in the game where the FPS drops to 4 frames per second (whereas I would be getting 60-75 pre-lag).

172125,"As a Flash developer in my day job, I was a little disappointed at Flash being cut out of the App Store when it was announced.  I have a love-hate relationship with Flash, as I suspect many Flash developers do, so I wasn't too crushed.  Nor was I too happy at the prospect of a flood of crappy web games landing at the App Store.  But it did cut off an avenue of my own development, so I completely understood why there was such a furor over the decision.

Now I understand why Apple didn't want Flash games on the App Store.

The process of exporting an ActionScript 3 project to iOS is pretty straightforward, but not a single one of our games that I tried exporting to iOS did anything other than slow to an abysmal crawl when run on an iPad or iPhone.  Now, to date, all our games have been vector-based, which I figured would tax a mobile processor pretty hard, so I wasn't too surprised by this.  I spent many hours trying to tweak, optimize, and refactor things to try to eke some speed out of the engine, and many more hours reading stuff on the internet, trying to see what recommendations and best practices there were for going from Flash to iOS.  I eventually came to the conclusion that nothing short of a complete rewrite, from the ground up, using raster graphics instead of vector, would produce anything playable.  Our games, as written, could not be ported.

""Fine,"" I thought.  ""Let's try it with a bitmap-based game,"" and I busted out a technology demo with a bitmap tile-based walkaround engine, like for an old-school RPG.  It was really fast on the laptop and desktop, but when I exported it to iPad, again, it slowed to a crawl.  Not as bad as the vector-based games, but still unplayable.

Now, I'm sure there are caveats, protips, and disclaimers that people with more experience  can point me to for optimizing my Flash engine on iOS.  There are, after all, some Flash games on the App Store.  I'm sure there are some techniques that could bring things up to speed, and there were probably some things I was not doing in an absolutely optimal way.

But here's the thing.  If the feasible space for Flash on iOS is so small that it requires refactoring your project entirely, eschewing vector art, and putting on your guru hat to get even reasonable performance, practically no one's existing library will work without rewrites.  And if that's the case, *we might as well code it natively*.

With that in mind, I grabbed the latest version of Cocos2d-iphone, and got to work reproducing the walkaround engine I had made in Objective C.  In a few evenings, I got it working fullscreen on an iPad, with three new features: Bresenham line of sight calculations, animated water tiles, and a boundless Perlin Noise-based terrain map generated *on the fly*.

How did it perform?  *60 FPS, baby.*  I'd get a little hiccup when it generated a few more 64x64 blocks of terrain tiles, but other than that, smooth as silk.

Even better was the fact that it was *enjoyable* coding in Objective C instead of Flash.  I could export to the simulator and see my game running in seconds.  Exporting to the device didn't take much longer.  In comparison, it took a good 3-4 *minutes* to test a game out of Flash.  That alone made me far more productive.

So, my advice is this:  If you're a Flash developer eyeing the App Store, skip the Flash exporter entirely, bite the bullet, and learn Objective C.  It will save you a lot of time and frustration in the long run.  Seriously, if you can program a game in ActionScript 3, you can program a game in Cocos2D and Objective C.  If you need a leg up, get the how-to book from the [71 Squared guys](http://www.71squared.com/) or something, but don't be intimidated by the learning curve.  It's within your reach.

172474,"Please bear with me.  I will have questions, but I think some context would help.  It's going to look like a rant and I apologize.  But I'm simply beside myself and I don't know what to do.

I'm 35, in good health, employed, don't have money problems, have active interests that help get me by day to day, close friends that I see on a regular basis, and a somewhat healthy relationship with my parents and siblings.  In other words, I don't have any significant turmoil in my life that would be an indication of an emotionally unhealthy environment.

My wife is 35, healthy, employed, doesn't have money problems, is very active in her hobby (of which I support financially and otherwise), has very close friends that she sees often, and has a better relationship with her parents and siblings than I do.  Again, nothing to indicate that she's living in an unhealthy environment.

We've been married for almost fifteen years, have two daughters ages twelve and nine, both of whom are healthy, bright, and active girls.  So no major issues there.

We've both made sacrifices for each other over the years.  We've both worked hard on making a nice home, saving for vacations, going out, etc.  So I can't say that either of us is overly selfish in any way.

I've never cheated on her, never caroused, hell, I've never even flirted with another woman.  And to my knowledge, she's never done the same.  In fact, we have a pretty good sex life.  Better than most people I know as far as I can tell.

But here's the deal: Every time I want to do something; every time it's my idea, especially if it's something that doesn't involve her, I have a fight on my hands.  Or, she belittles it.  Or, she makes me feel stupid for even suggesting it.  Or, after a long drawn out fight, I finally get my way, but then if the slightest thing goes wrong, I'm constantly reminded of what a horrible mistake I made.  I have no say over how the household money is spent.  I get little input on how my girls are to be raised.  I have no say in what goes in to or how the house should look and whatnot.

Meanwhile, if she's wanted me to adjust some of my behavior for her benefit, I did.  She wanted me to play less video games.  I cut back significantly.  She wanted me to be on the computer less.  I stopped bringing my laptop home from work.  She wanted me to not watch as many sports.  So I cut back on the games I enjoyed.  She wanted me to start cooking, even though I fucking hate cooking with a red hot passion.  But I did any ways because that's what was needed.  She wanted me to cut back on any useless spending.  So I did, only to see her come walking into the house the next day with bags of new clothes for her and the girls.  It's all justified, of course.

I don't feel like a man in my own house.  And what set it off last night was her being pissed at me for going to have lunch with a couple of mutual friends.  I was able to duck out of work early to do this.  But she didn't care.  She didn't care that I was willing to drive another two hours just to pick her up and bring her back there to join us.

And she does this shit ALL THE TIME.

So what the hell do I do?  This has been going on for years.  I stand my ground, I'm told I'm an asshole.  But I popped last night.  I mean I raged.  I've never screamed like that at any one.  But I was screaming at her, at our friends.  And the whole time it felt awesome, but completely humiliating.

Fortunately the girls weren't around to see or here this.  I'm certain had they been, this would have probably never happened.

How do I start picking up the pieces?  How do I tell her that in spite of all of this shit, I still love, that I still want to have a happy life with her?  How do I start repairing the damage I did to every one around me?  How can I look her in the eye and tell her that although I love her, she's been a huge part of my unhappiness?

**EDIT** - It's been one hell of a weekend.  I promise to respond to all of your input individually seeing as how all of you took the time to help my sorry ass.

Long story short: After my meltdown Friday night, my wife and my girls stayed at our friend's.  Gratefully she didn't drag her family into it.  My best friend talked me down from the ledge.  He helped me realize that I need help.  And I'm going to get that.  My wife loves me.  She didn't know.  She didn't know how unhappy I am.  And that's she absolutely terrified of losing me.  My girls have no idea what happened.

We've agreed to some things.  First, I'm going to write down what's been going through my head all of these years.  It's clear that something disconnects when I try to speak and it all comes out wrong.  We're going to go to counseling together and separate.  She acknowledges that she has a problem communicating, too.

I still love my wife.  But I have to get back to wanting what I have.  What I have with her.  With my girls.  With my life in general.  And I don't.  I've spent years telling myself that I have every reason to be happy.  But I'm not.  It's not just her.

172690,"Here's a list of my opinions and an arbitrary rating of each of the maps shipped with both MW2 and BlOps, with references to CoD4 maps. 

It's all subject to preference although I've tried to remain objective in most cases. High ratings are given for innovation, balance, variance of sight lines, and empahsis on variance in tactics of play. 

I'm at home with my xbox at university, with exams to study for, so such a procrastination is due to severe CoD withdrawal symptoms :)

My thoughts:

**MW2**

* **Afghan** - excellent all round map based around perimeter play, was better for some objectives more than others, and could prove quite campy, but overall had enough varied cover points and counter points to keep it interesting, 8/10

* **Derail** - far too big, too much time spent traversing the map, only really suited to ground war, SnD became a game of who had the biggest balls to run the furthest, all other game types became a cluster fuck for the centre house. Big =/= better, 3/10

* **Estate** - a fight for the centre house in most game types, if you controlled this you controlled the game, thus justifying danger close for some people. Poor overall design in my opinion, it looked pretty, but  was ultimately a poor map 4/10

* **Favela** - excellent mix of interesting sight lines, roof top battles, and clever short cuts, one of MW2s best offerings, never got bored of it in most game types 8/10

 * **Highrise** - the perfect CoD map, equal peggings, slightly ruinged by OP spawn sniping, which I'm sure was fun for some. How can you dislike it? Perhaps a little too symmetrical? Nah this is a classic in even the FPS genre overall, 9/10

* **Invasion** - standard CoD gridded map affair, three main routes with interlinking buildings, see Crash, Strike, or District from CoD4. If it aint broke... 6/10

* **Karachi** – it sounded like a vaginal euphemism, but was actually a well designed map that had few routes through the centre but enough cover of each one that no one vantage point was imperious. The satellite dish was where control could be found, and it only had two and a half routes to it. A good map but not a great one 6/10 

* **Quarry** – dominated by the high ground towards one corner of the map with three viable routes up to that area all with sloped ground making anybody a sitting duck, all TDMs became a struggle to control this area, with the buildings surrounding it having too great a vantage points, not a good design imo. Although it was a more enjoyable affair with other game types 5/10

* **Rundown** - a map not suited to many game types, B dom was a killzone, and FFA was a boosters paradise. It could have been massively improved with romoval of one eighth of its overall area getting rid of the garage and the back house. Not a fun map, too stand offish over the bridge heads, without much relief - 5/10

* **Rust**- like shipment only shit. Mainly due to the towering obstruction in the centre being too overwhelming, fundamental map design failure 2/10

* **Scrapyard** - standard map four perimeter buildings and small complex in centre, good for some game modes, terrible for others, nothing special 5/10

* **Terminal** - I'm sure everyone that played this agrees, it's a map of beauty, such an awesome setting, and a good blend of gun fight scenarios makes this my favourite and probably that of many others 10/10

* **Underpass** - meh see Invasion, yet rainy and depressing 5/10
  
* **Wasteland** - one of the most hot/cold maps ever, when doing well you love it when doing poorly you hate it. Such large sight lines, yet segmented with the cluster fuck centre. It was certainly interesting, if like me you figured out how to do well with a scar for example, you could make an entire lobby your collective bitch on this map. I'll give it a high rating for innovation, and unique layout, with realistic battleground feel 8/10

* **Sub Base** - standard affair, good for objective games, ruined by tac insertion boosting on FFA but so were many other maps, not much to say. Although it did provide building areas that managed not to create one superior location to camp in, so technically its design must be rather good. 7/10

* **Skidrow** - an excellent all round map, long corridors with vantage points made for interesting team based stand offs, leading to eventual flanking and rape, my personal favourite from this game, due to a clutch I once had in SnD ""this one time I had a clutch..."" 8/10

-----------------------------------------

**BlOps**


* **Array** – urghghgghgghhhhhhh, since I’ve actually gotten good at this map, I no longer wish cancerous aids upon its designer, perhaps just a violent cough. It’s piss poor map design in my opinion. The round house is far, far too dominant. Saying that: since I now control that house, without fail, I can confidently get a randy savage K/D on it. But do I have fun doing this? No. I’ll give it a 4 because in some game types it redeems it self; and reminds me of the fourth layer from Inception, and that is a good film... 4/10

* **Cracked** - Standard CoD grid affair, by grid let me clarify, that I mean a 3 by 3 sequential building situation, as seen in every CoD since the good old pre sprinting CoDs. 5/10

* **Crisis** - a grower, you immediately despise it because of its diarrhoea like textures; and your intital insistence on fighting in the concrete underbelly. Big mistake, fight for top control of sand bags and the house, and you’ll start to warm to this map, not a bad map by any means. The amount of secret jump short cuts, makes it a good objective map also. 7/10 

* **Firing Range** - Imo a brilliant map, without boasting or quoting my stats. I can tell you that (boasts about stats*) I am a gang of well hung gang rapists on this map. If you aren’t; I highly suggest the second floor of the side house, with a motion sensor a flak jacket and a chopper gunner, it’s the only map I camp in, much hate mail!  The actual design I feel is pretty solid, it manages to be a tiny map, yet have complex layers and routes, due to a clever use of a cliff and an invisible wall by the ‘ravine’. Splitting the map in two. Ever seen it not voted for? Exactly 9/10

* **Grid** – not a fan really, it’s a roughly symmetrical map, but with one building's second floor being utterly superior to the other's. This leads to, far too much fighting for this one building. Not a fan. 4/10

* **Hanoi** - uruggghghg nauseatingly bad map, its irregular symmetry, or lack thereof; and overly campy construction, ensure you won’t enjoy it. I actually spend time just looking at the gallows in one of its two centres hoping to end it all. 2/10

* **Havana** - excellent all round map, a perfect CoD affair, with an overall s shape, harking back to Crossfire. How can you not like it? Only misses out on being a 10, due lack of innovation 8/10

* **Jungle** – innovative scenario and layout, but with the usual three main routes. All routes have their own segmented compartmentalised firing zones making it full of enjoyable little skirmishes. Its good for close quarters and long range, I believe the only reason it isn’t a 10 is because it’s utterly unconvincing as a jungle, and an excellent example of Treyarch’s poor graphics textures 9/10

* **Launch** - great all round map very similar to Ambush in CoD4 in that the centre ground is higher than the two spawn sides, with a simlar mesh of interlocking cover points over on each side. Not a bad map by any means, although the Soyez rocket area is a little under ulitlised in death match modes. Leading to lob-sided fighting.  7/10

* **Nuketown** – underachieving son of Shipment, a good little map, if you’re in an organised team that understand the idea of not flipping a spawn it can be enjoyable; and FFA spawn traps are ^_^ delicious… for me mwhahaha. Fast and frenzied like fucking on cocaine 8/10

* **Radiation** - a great map, seriously its average, but a door, that you can open and close making objectives harder to take? with opposing switches, why hasn’t this been done before? Genius stuff. It’d be good to average otherwise, but I’ll give this a solid 9/10

* **Summit** – Brilliant map, ruined by spawn issues. I always think its array in the lobby for some reason then am pleasantly surprised when it comes up. It has balanced spawn areas, in terms of cover etc, with interesting fire fights in the centre, with just the right amount of cover causing a two levelled battle ground. Not too shabby 7/10

* **Villa** – Not the best map I’ve ever seen…. I believe it rewards a camping mentality, especially in big team modes, too many choke points overwatched from windows, with not enough routes to the camping areas. For example the window above ‘bar’ with only one staircase up to it. Or the massive balcony with only two door ways. C- must try harder 5/10 

* **WMD** – people seem to love this map, although I’ve yet to find a way to enjoy it, it seems too constipated, if that makes any sense, I get frustrated on it and lose my team too easily and end up being multi-fucked. I’m sure many others like it, however, based on  my friends and this subreddit, so I’ll faithfully give it a 6/10

------------------------------------------------------

**Results:**

MW2 16 maps, 98/160, average score 6.1

BlOps 14 maps, 90/140, average score 6.43

**Conclusion:** I need either a girlfriend, or to start studying. 
Haha no..

In conclusion, maps of either game are of a very similar quality, with levels displaying similar patterns of design.  The occasional innovative variation crops up, which can lead to interesting maps like Jungle or travesties like Hanoi.

It’s the gameplay of either game that make the difference if you played with the damage and gun recoil of MW2 on BlOps maps you’d have an entirely different experience. Be that to your personal preference or not.

173188,"Maybe I'm just oversensitive to the sensationalist media when it comes to the weather, but I'm starting to think there may be cause for real concern.  I'm sure the media using terms like ""snowmageddon"" and ""snowacalypse"" don't help matters, but I like to think I'm intelligent enough to observe what's happening and come to my own conclusions...  Here's what's concerning me:

1.  An increased frequency in unusually low temperatures across the United States, and across much of Europe during the winter months.  

2.  Southeastern United States getting a lot more winter activity (snow, sleet, freezing rain), while the Northeast seems to be having milder winters.

3.  Unusually active tornado seasons.

4.  Unusually active hurricane seasons.

5.  I admit I pay less attention to what's going on outside of the United States, but I do believe I hear more about snow in Europe these days than I used to.  Hearing things like ""Iraq gets first snowfall on record"" can be cause for alarm.

6.  Speaking of which, you hear these things on an almost regular basis now: record-breaking highs and lows, record-breaking snowfalls, record-breaking droughts, record-breaking rainfalls.  I keep hearing people saying, in regard to some weather occurrence (on the news, or in person): ""I've never seen anything like this.""

I do realize that weather cycles have very long periods, and what seems to be unusual could just be a natural progression of a cycle.  But the rapidity and severity of these changes seems, to a mere mortal human, at least unusual if not alarming.

Is anyone else noticing these things?  Is there a pattern to all of this, perhaps correlating across multiple disciplines (astronomy and meteorology, for example)?  

Finally, if this is something to attribute to the current solar minimum, what will the upcoming solar max bring?  Someone out there in the hivemind must have an educated idea.

174107,"I've yet to find a way to avoid watching mediocre series. I have several approaches, but none seem too reliable. One obvious approach is to look at ratings. The problem with this is that no matter where I go, ratings are highly biased in favor of new trendy shows. Using this method exclusively would rule out many classics which are, in my humble opinion, actually pretty damn good. Also, it seems the ratings have a heavy bias towards moe, or other otaku oriented anime. I mean, sure, k-on had quite a few redeeming qualities, but it never really struck me the way it did for other anime fans. 

Another approach would be to read reviews. I would think that the more eloquent a review, the more I would trust it, since it seems like the reviewer knows his stuff. I just finished *Hale+Guu*, and really didn't think too greatly of it. The thing is, I started the series after reading extremely eloquent reviews praising it to the heavens. I've found that mediocre comedy and pointlessly emotional melodrama seem to evoke really well written reviews. I'm finding more and more that I can't trust reviews.

Now, a third approach is to find a reviewer that you generally agree with, and follow any anime that he's rated highly. This usually works, but lots of times s/he will inexplicably love something that isn't that great. Maybe it's nostalgia, maybe it somehow struck a nerve that I don't have, who knows. 

Another technique that I've tried is just following a director. This isn't perfect, but it works reasonably well. I have pretty good chances with Miyazaki, Anno, Kon or Shinbou. However, the director doesn't always write the stories, so all this guarantees me is good direction.

I've found that one of the most successful techniques to me recently is to simply look at artwork and the description. I've found anime this way that I never would have checked out based on ratings, reviews, or favorite reviewers. For example, I loved the crud out of *Dance in the Vampire Bund*, which has abysmal ratings, and all of my favorite reviewers dislike it. 

So, does anyone else have any tips for improving my game? How do you find good anime?

I got forwarded an interesting email about Thomas Jefferson's accomplishments that ended on a troubling ""Founding Fathers/Christian Nation"" note. My mom is still quite progressive, and what followed was a dialogue on Jefferson's Deism and the idea of God's involvement/disinvolvement in evolution/creation. 

Anyhoo. No more ado. Enjoy. But also please critique this if you could!


&gt;True!
&gt;
I realised that the way I phrased it was odd. I meant the Deism comment to highlight a fact that is often either willfully ignored or misunderstood by bible belters calling him a ""patriot"" or founding father in a Christian Nation.
&gt;
&gt;I conceive intelligent design to be an apt description, but have also been given this thought:
If you asked a penguin, or a jellyfish for that matter, how the world was created. They might observe man as we observe the jellyfish, and say that on the seventh day, God finally created the jellyfish.
The more we learn about other species and life forms (whales especially), the more we begin to understand that they all possess incredible aptitudes for learning and thought. I believe that intelligent design extends beyond human life, and includes the mechanism of macroevolution. God is omnipresent in time as well, and never leaves our side, however we may be. But I have a genuine problem when humans consider themselves so powerful and exceptional in God's eyes that they regard themselves as a higher form of life than:
&gt;1)animals
&gt;2)God's ecosystems
&gt;3)other humans.
&gt;
&gt;The ego on man is, in my opinion, the most difficult thing to overcome. Even I squish ants. We like to consider other animals as inferior because ""where are their skyscrapers and automobiles?"" I believe that because other species live in harmony with others and give them space, with no ownership through pesticides, etc. they are rather superior things.
&gt;
&gt;We have told ourselves and told ourselves that we were God's ultimate triumph. This may be so, but need to recognize our part in the world, and that God created everything as perfectly as he did us. Even the mechanisms of adaptation that have preserved life on earth from fragile beginnings across several violent ice ages.
&gt;
&gt;But that might be just me.
&gt;Love you!

His last roomate (one of the two I mentioned [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/dn8p2/reddit_what_are_you_worst_roommate_stories/c11hayf)) would get upset when my bf would visit me for a few days. He once said that Chris (my bf) didn't have any right to what went on in the house because he was never there.  
  
His current roomate is even worse. He always wants to know where Chris is. He gets pissy when he's been gone for a few days. Since neither of us have cars, Chris usually comes over to my house on his days off. A few days ago, my bf mentioned getting a 2nd job near my end of town, and his roomate proclaimed ""You have to make a choice, are you living over there or here?!""

-Hardware acceleration from full to basic using dxdiag

-Turned off Data Execution Prevention for BF:BC2

-Changed in-game settings including:

high, medium, low textures

HSAO on/off

Bloom on/off

anisotropic filtering and MSAA 1x/off

Headphone quality sound/HiFi

Most problems caused by religion are caused by strict adherence to the scriptures, and most organized religions rely on them to give them power over the people by putting 'scriptural scholars' behind the altar. I think if we can take the scriptures off their pedestals we can teach our children wholesome spirituality without bigotry and segregation, and religious people's experience of their faith will be upgraded, not diminished.)

In order for me to believe in unconditional love and mercy as being characteristics of our Creator, I've concluded that the scriptures (Torah, Bible, Koran, Etc.) are NOT written by Him/Her. Instead, I've utilized my free will to decide to rely on the tools I've been given: Intellect, Intuition, my Conscious and Emotion, among others, to get me as close to the truth as possible, to enable me to try to make the best decisions possible. Surely I'll continue to make mistakes along the way, but I'll learn, and best of all, I'm NOT afraid I won't make it to heaven, as I'm confident ALL that have been created (against their free will) by the Creator will end up in the same heaven as the rest of us. 
Therefore, I also do not have any hatred towards what others call 'sinners', and I don't end debates with them by saying: ""well you're going to hell, I hope you enjoy it- Ha!""

That's just not how the Creator I believe in rolls.

TL;DR: I believe in ""God"", but I also believe in False Religions and I think it's important for religious/spiritual people to trust their own intuition and judgments, rather than blindly follow some spiteful books.

If you believe in God, do you think he'll think badly of you if you decide to take the scriptures with a grain of salt? If no, why not jump ship?",-1,-1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

180004,"First off I wanna say that I'm not a smoker myself; I've done it before and decided it wasn't my thing. That being said, I'm very pro-cannabis and pro-legalization and all of that stuff. Almost all of my friends are avid smokers, and I personally have never felt pressured by any of them to smoke against my better judgement. I lurk trees a lot (I've posted once or twice) and I'm always really impressed by how level-headed and chill the community is.

What I'd like to ask about about is your views on people who choose to abstain entirely from smoking; who never try it and never intend to. The reason I'm asking is because of [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/eo6km/reddit_is_so_diverse_i_had_this_idea/c19lufe) comment thread. A few people are calling this kid out because he says that he's never tried cannabis and that it's not his thing. They're saying that he couldn't possibly know it's not his thing unless he's tried it... and I think that's kind of a messed up thing to say. If he wants to smoke, that's awesome; if he doesn't want to, that's awesome too. I feel like some of these comments are challenging that, and almost pressuring him to smoke or implying that he's ignorant if he doesn't smoke. Now, if he were trying to tell other people they shouldn't smoke that'd be another story, but if it's just his personal decision, I think people should respect that.

One thing I'd like to clarify is that I'm not saying that someone can necessarily predict whether or not they'd enjoy being high without trying it first, but rather that someone can absolutely decide they don't ever want to get high without having previously been high, and that no one should tell them their decision is wrong or closed-minded.

So do you guys think that someone has to try pot before they can say it's not their thing? Do you think it's okay to just decide to never do it, or would you say that's ignorant or presumptuous? I'm really interested to get your feedback on this and hopefully get a feel for the overall opinion of the community.

180016,"So I am visiting my brother who lives in Seattle, WA. The neighborhood he lives in, Capital Hill, it's a really cool neighborhood with a lot of arts and culture and a pretty cool  bar scene. Seattle has a fairly substantial gay populations, and according to wikipedia Capital Hill is the center of LGBT lifestyle in the city (referring collectively to lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people). I'm from a small town on the eastern side of Washington State, which  tends to lean heavily towards the conservative side of things. Now in no way homophobic, at all, my family is fairly liberal and I am really tolerant and accepting of all lifestyles, I really mean that. With that said, I was walking home back to my brothers apartment from the bars, it was around 2:45 I believe, and right in front of his building on a fairly lit sidewalk were two gentleman, one standing, and one on his knees performing the lovely art of fellatio  on the other. No one else was on the street, I just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time I guess. I was in complete shock, one of them yelled ""hey, are you some kind of a cop?"" I just muttered ""nope"", kept my head down and walked quickly towards his apartment. So I was wondering, has anyone seen anything remotely close to something this bizarre in a big city? I'm not asking if public oral sex is a common thing to come across, I doubt that it is, but I guess what I'm asking is this something that wouldn't surprise people if they did come across it having lived in a liberal city like Seattle.

180022,"Note: Made a throwaway so I could reveal my age without it being tied to my account. Also, read the whole thing before replying, or just read the tl;dr.

I'm a 16 year old male, she is a 16 year old female.

Backstory: I seen her in the hallway a few times in 9th grade (May 2009, we were both 14 then and our birthdays are in August). Talked to a female friend from another city, she encouraged me to talk to her. I was/am nervous in social situations, especially with girls I find attractive.

One day I walked up to her and started a conversation. Got her number and called her that night. We talked a few more times every few days on the phone and through Myspace.

She asked me to go with her to Warped Tour in July, not a fan of her music be agreed nonetheless. I was pretty awkward the whole time. As in, we were in a crowd of people jumping and screaming, including her, and I just stood there. My back made me very miserable that day as we stood for about 9 hours straight and I wore loose shoes. Getting a little off track here with my memories...

We kept in contact throughout the summer.

When school started up (In September. 10th graders now, USA, btw) we were in the same class. I was still nervous around and her and choose a seat one away from her (diagram: my seat |_| empty seat between us |_| her seat |_|). She got up and said, ""well I want to sit next to you,"" and moved over to the empty seat.

At this point I was very much so (and thought she was) interested into taking our friendship and turning it into a relationship.

We kept talking daily. Hanging out almost every other weekend.

In October, I decided to make a move, whether it was for better or worse because I was becoming irritated at my own fear of rejection.

We were coming back from a drive in movie (in which we shared a blanket between us. not a needed part of the story, but whatever) and were in her mom's van.

I said to her, after much overthinking, ""Hey let's try something out."" She says ""Ok."" I take her hand and hold it in mine. Note: It was about 10pm and we were in the last row of seats where it was impossible for her mom to see us. I say, ""Do you like holding hands?"" She nods and smiles and then says, ""Yeah."" We hold hands for another minute or so, then mutually stop.

I find out over the course of a few days, that she told a friend of her's that I know but didn't care for, that I was creepy for holding her hand. I was stricken by this, after seeing her positive reaction. 

On the bus home I see her friend, the one I didn't care for. He says ""[Her] doesn't like you [Me]. She thinks you are a weird loser.""

Not gonna lie; I secretly cried into my hoody as if I were sleeping.

Thinking she didn't like me at all, I did my best to ignore her completely, fearing she would rub the pain in more. (Obviously I didn't think this through, and you know, just *talked* to her. But we all make mistakes.)

After a few days she apparently catches wind of me ignoring her, and comes up to me in class and says ""I want to be your friend still.""

Now I was thinking I was 100% I was friendzoned, hard, after being a pussy and not just asking her out. (This is what I seriously thought then. Still didn't just *talk* to her.)

Up until December we were still talking regularly at school, not on the phone or over the internet.

The anger inside me from me thinking I was friendzoned built up (Nope. Still didn't talk to her about any of my feelings) was building amazingly high. One day before school I texted her ""I really want to talk to you about something that has been bugging me."" Her reply ""You might as well not even talk to me today then, I'm not talking about anything in school."" I fucking lost it there. ""What the fuck ever. I'm not your little bitch that you can just leash around and control (Yeah, I regret all of this), and beckon whenever you feel like it."" She says ""Right. Because *that's* what I was doing. Whatever though."" I replied ""Right.""

And that was that.

I never talked to her in school or any other medium again. Signed up for an online school a week or two before. Helped her sign up too. I was gone within that week.

We had to go to state testing in April of this year. I knew she would be there since she signed up for the school too. I looked at her, and she looked back. After that, we both just kept our heads down. I was going to talk to her on the last test day and try to salvage this broken mess we made. She sat on the bench outside waiting for her mom. I look at her, and she looks up, I stop for a moment as if I was trying to get my tongue back. Then I just walk across the street.

And that's it. Thanks for reading.

My question I would like advice on is: Should I try to talk to her again? I really want to make up for everything I said, but I know I am not the only one to blame here, we both did wrong. I still yearn for her friendship though. Amazingly sweet girl. If I shouldn't try to talk to her, why?

One last note: Please do not belittle my problem because of my age. I get that I over think things, and I shouldn't worry because we be friends forever. But screw all that. I want to be her friend again, but only if she wants to be mine, obviously. I know you can't answer if she does because there is no way for any of us to know, but I am rambling again. I will answer any questions you need to make a better mental picture of the situation as long as it doesn't disclose us or our location.  



tl;dr I started talking to a girl. Held her hand. Thought she friendzoned me for not asking her out. We start talking again. My anger builds and I lash out at her and give her the cold shoulder for 8 months. I regret this, and want to be her friend (I don't care about a ""relationship"" with her anymore. If it happens, hell yeah). Please don't brush off my problems because of my age.

Both sites are looking to future legalization and regulation within the United States, and have pulled out of the state to be in line with a current state law.

Not the worst situation, all I have to do to play on one of the sites is travel outside of the state, so I will do just that, to Vegas at least once before the World Series.  Once the series comes in late May, I'll be there for at least a month.

In the meantime, I'm bored with no Sunday tournaments, AMA.

181969,"There is this convenient store (a *depanneur* as we call them in Quebec) right around the corner from where I live. It is held by a family of Indian immigrants. One of them, a beautiful girl, usually works at the cash at nights. She barely speaks English and doesn't speak French at all. Or so I thought.

I go there very often to buy cigarettes, beer or milk. Over the last few months, I've come to know her two brothers. They are very nice people. They make you feel that you are important to them. It's like they know when you feel like chatting, or if you just woke up and just want in and out as fast as possible.

Back to the girl. She seems like a very shy girl. She tilts her head down a bit when I'm alone with her. Two weeks ago, I went there with one of my friends and as soon as we came out, he told me that she obviously was into me. I didn't really realize it before. I just thought she was just shy around men or uncomfortable because of her cultural background.

That girl is simply beautiful and the idea of dating her made it's way into my head, even though I thought this would be impossible. Yesterday morning, I decided I would talk a bit with one of her older brothers to see what he thought about the idea.

Well, at first he was completely silent. He just looked at me frowning. I said that maybe it wasn't a good idea after all and was about to leave when he said ""Wait... Let me talk to you about something.""

He went on about the story of his family. How his parents died a couple of years ago. How he, his brother and his wife came to Quebec 6 years ago. How he and his brother adopted the Quebec lifestyle. How they were able to bring their little sister (the beautiful girl) one year ago after 5 years of separation. And on and on. Fascinating story!

It turns out that the sister is taking classes in a French university. She speaks a little French but is shy to do it. She complains that she is living a boring life, doesn't have any friends, and is kind of lost around here. He told me that me hanging out with her would be a very good thing for her, but that it was against their religion and culture. But at the same time, he and his brothers don't have much time to spend trying to to cheer her up and make her meet an Indian man in Montreal.

Then, the frown came back on his face. ""Are you a good man?"" I said ""Yes, of course. Let's put it this way. If I go out with your sister, all we will do is hang out and have fun. We will all be clear about it from the beginning. I will not try to have sex with her, or even kiss her. She will practice her French and meet interesting people. And everyone I know who will meet her will benefit from meeting someone from another culture. And you, too, will come to know me. I just want to be friends with her, that's all.""

To my surprise, he replied: ""You don't go breaking her heart, OK?""

I said: ""Well, that I can't promise. If she falls in love with me, it will be because she likes who I am. And also, there is the chance that it doesn't fit and that this will end after one night together.""

He laughed. He told me that he was OK with it, but made me promise that I would act like a gentleman and a friend. 

So yesterday night, I went there to buy some milk even though I had enough in the fridge. I saw in her eyes that her brother told her about the story. We both laughed even though I hadn't said a single word. I asked her if she would want to go out next Wednesday. She said yes. I asked her what she liked to do. She replied in French that she always wanted to go bowling since she saw the movie ""Kingpin"" when she was younger. Yes, Kingpin, my favorite comedy ever...

So, I ask you Reddit... Do you have any tips for me? Anything I should know about Indian culture to make it a good first night and not fuck this up?

182205,"OK so I just pissed off my very Mormon neighbor today. First let me give you a little history. I left the church a few years ago, I no longer, believe in the church, or in a god, I am an atheist. My brother served a mission, but no longer believes in the church, he still thinks there might be a god though, but that, if god exists, god is probably way different than any church makes god out to be. 

This September, in order help save money, my brother and I moved into to an apartment together here in Provo by splitting rent; also for me to be closer to family who are all in Utah county (I moved from SLC). From the time we moved in we have had this neighbor who has been very friendly, giving us bottled fruit, home-maid jams, and other treats, but early on we got on the discussion of church, and I politely told her I was no longer an active member. Ever since then, She's been cleverly been trying to do missionary work. Dropping by invitations to ward events, and giving us LDS pamphlets, along with treats, etc. 

One day she came by and said she was 'The Block Master' for a community, emergency preparedness program, and had some pages about food storage, what to do in an emergence, and ways to signal in the window how urgently we need help in-case of a natural disaster, etc., but she also had a questionnaire to fill out, that was full of questions like, what was your former ward, who was your former bishop, how long have you been a member, did you serve a mission. If so where, etc. Curiously soon after we had missionaries stop by. Every time she would stop by with these things I'd politely remind her I was not active longer, and subtly try to make it clear I was not interested in returning to church. I've never gone into detail with her about what I really think of the church, I've always thought it would be too confrontational.

So this morning at 8 AM she comes knocking on the door. Which is early for me, and she knew it because previously she had stopped by at 10 am one weekend, and saw that I had just woken up, and I told her how I'm not much of a morning person. Anyway this morning she came asking if I would come to church today, because it was the Christmas program, and she was singing in the choir. I told her once again I was not a church-goer any longer, she then said in a suddenly very loud, almost angry voice, (I'm quoting as best I can remember) “Can't you just go this once for the special celebration, of birth of our savior Jesus Christ! Even Catholics go to church twice a year for Christmas, and Easter, can't you be a Catholic!” I then told her very sternly “I'm really not interested in going back to church.” She then then ask me to go wake up my brother right then, and ask if he wanted to go to church. At this point I was ready to explode, I couldn't believe how demanding she was being. I knew my brother would probably not want to go either, and that he would probably be mad that he was so rudely awakened, though he was probably already awake with her yelling so loud. So I told her he probably would not be interested either. She then got this shocked look on her face and yelled, clearly angry “He should know better! He served a mission! He proselyted to the world about the truth of the gospel!” This finally made me snap ,and I said out loud to her “I don't need this!” and I slammed the door in her face, and walked away.

The funny thing is I'm really not an angry person. I'm usually very quiet, keep to myself, and try to be very non-confrontational. I have never even once gotten angry at a neighbor before. I guess she was just pushing all the wrong buttons too early in the morning, and I couldn't take anymore of her trying to cram religion down my throat. Since then all I have been able to think about is how I should have said something even worse like, “You know what I think about your religion!?! I think Jesus, and your God is just a fairytale, and Joseph Smith, Brigham Young, and a host of other early prophets and founders where a bunch horny con-men!” Then slam the door.

Is that Bad?

Thanks, I just needed to vent and get this off my chest.

UPDATE: She just came back with a face almost in tears, and apologized. The experience this morning probably ruined her whole Sunday Christmas service. I told her everything is fine. I just hope she was sincere, and that she will tone down her religious zealotry from now on.

The Omanyte Before Christmas  
By Me
  
‘Twas the night before Christmas and all through Japan  
from the top of Mt. Moon to the old SS Anne  
Not one person or Pokémon moved, for they knew  
If they weren’t asleep, Santa wouldn’t come through.  
In a shanty old house up in north Pallet Town  
Some magical things were about to go down.  
A young Drowzee boy lay asleep in his bed  
while sugarplum Clefairies danced in his head.  
Then he heard at midnight, Rhydon the minute,  
A sleigh and the loud Gastly voice that was in it.  
“On Golbat, on Fearow, on Beedrill, Doduo  
On Moltres, on Zapdos and on Articuno!  
To the Machop of the porch, Kabutop of the wall,  
Rapidash away, dash and Sandslash away all!”  
Then the boy heard on the top of his roof  
The Rattata-tat-tatting of each little hoof.  
Outside his window on that Christmas Eevee  
Was a creepy old man, intrusive and skeevy.  
He let himself in and he took a small looksie  
At a tall glass of milk with a big Psyduck-ookies.  
The old man looked north and the old man looked south  
Then e-Raticated the plate, put them all in his Meowth.  
But too fast, the old sport started Koffing and Weezing  
Machoking to death while convulsing and seizing  
He made such a ruckus while grasping for air  
That he rose to the little boy standing right there.  
“Why is this stranger in my living room?  
You’re not Santa; this Christmas is nothing but Gloom.  
Are you crazy? Retarded or mentally Slow, bro?  
Are you some kind of vagrant or Krabby old hobo?”  
Then the old man yelled out with the might of a lioness  
“I’M THE WORLD’S NUMBER ONE POKEMON SCIENTIST!  
I’m a professor and my name is Oak  
I’m here to give Pokémon to you young folk.  
It’s the season to give and to spread Christmas cheer.  
And I’m Seaking a boy who has been good this year.  
I know that it sounds quite Farfetch’d, but it’s true.  
Is there any small Chansey that that boy is you?”  
He then pulled out three pokéballs from his stow  
Red, blue, and green, each one topped with a bow.  
Oak said “Choose one of these guys to be your trainee”  
and right off the young boy knew which one it would be.  
He picked up the red one and smiled; Oak did too.  
Yelling out loud “Charmander, I choose you!”  
Gary Oak then burst in with a jump and a hurtle  
and said like a douche “In that case, I’ll take Squirtle!”  
So our boy set out in that snowy December  
To become a trainer the world would remember.  
With his pal Charmander, his journey begun  
He packed all his bags and embarked down Route 1.  
He ran and he ran, getting faster and faster  
Not stopping 'til he was a Pokémon master.  
  
So enjoy the season and do with the break whatever you intend.  
Merry Christmas to you and your family too and to everyone you call a friend.  
Christmas this year will come and go just like it always does,  
But I hope this one’s the very best, like no one ever was.

I don't feel like I can quite eat how much they tell me to eat.

My days go something like this: 6 egg whites with breakfast, 6 oz. can of tuna for lunch (tsp of mayo), recovery drink with a scoop of protein powder and creatine after working out, then dinner with at least two servings of protein, a carb, and maybe a vegetable or two. Then I usually snack on a fruit or a dairy at some point. This seems to sustain me: I get hungry and then I eat (I probably eat something every 3 hours at least). The only time I would say I actually get hungry, but don't eat, is within 3 hours of bed: I assume this is alright, since we were told not to. In any case, I don't feel like I'm reaching the calories or filling all the groups that I'm supposed to. Is this a problem?

184592,"I don't expect this to be a popular post based on the current sentiment here, but I feel like this is an opinion that needs to be expressed by someone.

I've been playing TF2 for over 2 years. Not as long as some, but enough to consider myself an experienced player. I started with the Xbox version, which is ""vanilla"" to this day with zero unlocks or new maps. I waited in futility for months for Valve to deliver on their promise to bring PC updates to the console. Eventually I gave up and installed a Windows partition on my mac. I could go back and play ""classic"" TF2 anytime I want, but I wouldn't dare because I love the variety we have now.

**TF2 is as good as it's ever been.** All these new items you love to complain about? They barely change the game. The best scouts still use the scattergun, the best soldiers still use the rocket launcher, the best demomen still use pipes and stickies, and the best snipers still use the sniper rifle. None of these polycount items have changed the game more than, say, the kritzkrieg, jarate, or letting engies move their gear and level 3 sentries to the front line. And none of you were saying shit back then.

The two (in my opinion) most useful polycount packs are hardly game-breaking either. I'm rarely killed by milkmen scouts (and they sure miss their pistol), and saharan spies are still just as flammable as regular ones. The saharan set rewards good spies and mercilessly punishes bad ones. If you let an undisguised spy get behind your team, you guys deserve to be stabbed. And if you don't notice a backstab kill notification or the distinctive stabbing sound effect, the spy deserved that kill as well. Not to mention the sniper now has *three* anti-spy weapons (jarate, razorback, shiv) and the engie has a wrench that makes them bleed.

I'm only focusing on the spy because he has arguably the best set though. So on to other complaints. You're whining that you have to buy the new items? No you fucking don't, and you can safely delete every crate that ever drops for you. Like I said, you're already competitive without these new items, and besides, they still drop like any other. Sure, it'd be nice if they were achievement-linked too, but that's hardly worth bitching over. I don't feel like any of these polycounters have an unfair advantage over me, because they have their own weaknesses and I rely on skill and teamwork to exploit them. Items that *did* change how you have to deal with someone - the razorback and chargin' targe most notably - were adapted to quickly and the complaints about them now are rare. And if that still doesn't change your opinion about the Mann-conomy, you can still trade or craft whatever it is you ~~need~~ want.

If anything, I'd say trading has had the worst effect on TF2 - it turned people into greedy little shits who spam the chat box with unrealistic demands. But that, along with my other issues with trading don't prevent me from enjoying the game. But since I'm in rant mode, I'll share my other thoughts about it. Hats used to be rare and a huge deal to see on someone. I always said if trading came, hats would lose their value because anyone could have any hat they wanted. And that's largely been the case. Now everyone has their favorite hat for their most-played class and hats are no longer rare or valuable. (That's not to say I don't like them - I like the axtinguisher even though it isn't rare or valuable.) And for all you who want an unusual - be careful what you wish for. In a year, the same thing will happen and every teammate will have a flaming cloud around their head. We'll cross that bridge when we get to it though - the point is I find stuff that annoys me too, but I don't whine about the free content and I still love the game as much as ever.

Finally, there's the people complaining about the dilution of the art style. I suppose this is the most valid complaint, but I feel like we brought it upon ourselves. We've been begging for hats for a year and a half now - what did you think would happen? Valve is just giving us what we want. And I think trading is to blame for this too. That's why everyone you see is wearing a funny hat now - they liked the hat and traded for it. Some people are never happy.

tldr: Stop whining. Valve has given us more free content than I've ever seen for any other game. None of the new stuff you can **optionally** buy puts you at a disadvantage if you don't have it.",-1,-1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Well guess what, your guilty conscience was right: you should feel bad, maybe even worse than if you had pirated the games outright.


The bundle lets customers pay any price, true, but you still had some choice with conventional distribution: buy it at the regular price, or pay nothing and pirate it.


The bundle serves to give buyers an option between those two extremes. Regularly, you might say ""This game's price is $20, but I wouldn't pay more than $10 for it. I guess I'll just pirate it."" With the bundle, you are actually able to pay $10 if that's all it's worth to you.


I don't have much sympathy for pirates, but I can at least understand where they're coming from: $60 is a lot of money, and frankly, few games are worth that much to me. Paying nothing hugely undervalues a game, but when the only other alternative is up in the $50 - $60 range, it makes sense to me that people flock to piracy.


But with this bundle, even that excuse is removed. These games are obviously worth more than $0.01, so choosing to pay that when you can literally choose any price is an insult to the work of the developers.

several months ago i met my current girlfriend. And to be straight to the point, she's been the greatest lay i've ever had. Things were great because we were relaxed, honest and comfortable with our bodies.

now, I'm more of a vanilla person when it comes to sex. i know sexxit might not appreciate that, but not all of us are turned on by threesomes, anal and orgies. recently i've come to know more about my girlfriend - that she has an interest in all of these things, and might even be interested in MMF and FFM, if only as something that she thinks about.

let's get this straight - i actually love my girlfriend still. but while we're having sex, usually after releasing the tension of the first orgasm - my brain remembers all of this, and i lose my hard-on - i just get turned off when i imagine these things. i distract her by making small talk or doing something else until i can get going again. i've begun to think that we are sexually incompatible. sexxit, you can blame it on me, but that's the way my brain, and in extension, thats the way my emotions run.

Since “why don’t you believe in God” is so frustrating. This phrase helps put the burden of proof back on the yeasayers where it belongs.

It works because the theist must now, as is appropriate, present a case for why God exists (instead of you one for why God doesn’t).

187176,"Our fifth and final remodel job is coming up for our house... [the kitchen](http://tandy400.imgur.com/house_remodel/llQfy).  Just made [this Imgur album](http://tandy400.imgur.com/house_remodel), just for you, to check out our progress from the previous rooms. 

 I've become pretty proficient at demo, drywalling, among other things, but do you have any protips this guy can learn from?  I'm on a pretty tight budget, so this has been the ultimate DIY challenge - and the kitchen will be no exception.

A couple questions:

* My wife and I are still debating on vinyl vs. tile vs. laminate.  Since we're on a tight budget and I'd like to be done with this remodel ASAP, vinyl would be the obvious choice.  We could either do the rolled vinyl or [this bitchin' vinyl tile](http://www.armstrong.com/flooring/vinyl-tile/carlsbad-ii-grey-resilient-vinyl-tile-A0255/floor-107577.asp).  A friend of mine used it and said you have to pretty much get on your hands and knees to tell it's not actually ceramic.  The only problem is that we can't find the latter type anywhere.  We did laminate in the living and computer room and I'm impressed in how it turned out, but I'm not sure how I feel about it for the kitchen.  Opinions on this?

* Cabinets.  We are buying unfinished oak cabinets and staining them ourselves, stain color TBD but we would like to keep it medium-light colored.  As you can see in the pics, we have around 12 cabinets to stain, so using little foam brushes is not feasible.  What type of stain gets the best coverage, and what's the best way to do so?  Also, should we get the stuff with clear coat in it, or just do it separate?

* Any other tips that would maximize the quality that I can get out of this room?  The kitchen on this house is a huge selling point because of its size, and that also makes it a potential money pit.  There is a ton of stuff I'd like to do, but we will be selling the house in about a year in a half when I'm done with school so I really can't sink a lot of money in it.  At the same time, I love to cook so I want a great kitchen, and I want it to rock the socks off of potential buyers whenever we do end up selling the place.

I will keep you posted in the next month on the progress and follow up with some final pics - demo starts next week after Christmas.  I made a mock-up in Google Sketchup of the layout we're going with but it's on my other computer... I'll add it here with some screen shots when I get to it later.  Thanks for your help!

187586,"I’ve been on the site for 6 months now.  Have messaged probably 130 women, been on 10-12 dates, fooled around or had some kind of sexual encounter with a couple women.  Here’s what I learned, hope it helps:

1.	**Don’t build them up too much**
I mean two things by this:

a.	Don’t get hung up on any one girl too early

b.	Don’t imagine them as being your dream girl or being one way or another until you actually meet them.

To Elaborate:

a.	I’ve messaged an amazing girl for 6 weeks (she was out of town) and had her flake out at the last second.  I went on an awesome date with a gorgeous 5’10” model, had her write me saying how much she enjoyed the date, only to have her delete her account a couple weeks after our date. I had an awesome time fooling around with one girl only to have her lose interest.  It’s so fun to get excited or be stoked on a particular girl you like, but try not to get ahead of yourself.  You’ll come off as needy to them and get yourself really disappointed when things fizzle out.  Most things will fizzle out or not work out.  Expect it and just enjoy the chase and the action you do get.

b.	Don’t put them on a pedestal.  I found myself reading through a girl’s profile and imagining and projecting all sorts of things about her.  She became more amazing and interesting in my head the more I let my mind run away.  Dude, she’s just a person.  She could be fun, she could make good conversation, she might not.  She might bring up things that are really not that attractive.  She might be totally boring and sarcastic.  You don’t know til you talk face to face.  Go into the in person meet up excited and ready to chat, but be aware that you don’t know her yet.  Let her be herself and be aware that she’ll have good things and bad things that you didn’t see coming.  The mystery of getting to know her is way more exciting than any girl you could have constructed in your mind.

2.	**Call them first**
You can tell a lot from her writing style and photos, but not everything.  Have a short conversation on the phone before the in-person meet up is a good way to:
a.	Determine if she’s worth your time and the conversation will go ok.
b.	Develop a little rapport so the first in-person meeting isn’t so awkward.

3.	**Give her a chance**
I’m a very warm extroverted guy; I turn on naturally around people and under pressure.  I like this in a girl.  A lot of girls won’t turn on naturally, a lot of them can be quite nervous and even cold at first.  If you’re attracted to her and think there could be potential, give her a date or two more before you write her off (or come to like her).  I’m aware this might contradict previous points, I obviously am still not sure how much of chance to give them.

4.	**Show more, tell less**
You say you’re spontaneous, chivalrous, innovative, curious, clever, risky, etc…
Realize that almost everyone is saying how they have fun socially desirable traits.  Why not show her you are these things with stories and photos?  It’ll be far more believable.

5.	**Assess the competition and steal their tactics**
Reverse the match search, and search other straight guys’ profiles.  You’ll start to see patterns and you’ll see the site from her perspective.  Obviously, you can’t understand “what women want” but it’ll probably give you ideas for your profile and understand how you fit in to the pool of single men.  I think you’ll start to understand what works and what doesn’t.

6.	**Don’t sell yourself short**
At least 3-4 times, I started my messages with disqualifying statements.  I’d start with something like “I know, I know, I’m a bit young for you…”  Why did I do that?  I have no idea.  Don’t do it.  Go in confident, give her your best shot, let her shoot you down, don’t shoot yourself down.

7.	**Personality and rapport matter most** 
This goes back to projecting about the girl.  I’ve had meet ups where before I wasn’t sure if this or that was quite right about the girl.  I remember literally thinking “she has kind of a really wide face” about a girl who turned out to be really fun and attractive upon meeting up.   All that bullshit you make up in your head will just fade away when you meet her.  Go for personality, go for rapport, go for the vibe.  I had the pleasure of getting naked with some okc girls who had Victoria Secret worthy bodies.  Not many, but a couple.  It was great at first: running my hands on the those hip bones, those legs!  Sure it’s nice and I’m glad I experienced it.  But if they don’t have personality and a connection with you, the awesomeness of looks just fade away.  The flesh loses its wow factor and being around her becomes more work than it’s worth.  Go for rapport.  When there’s rapport, her flaws just seem to fade away.
This is a hard one obviously, looks always have their pull.  Maybe you need to get bored with looks for yourself.

8.	**Fail often**
At this point, I’m so used to the site, that I just fire out random messages here and there to see if I can get a response.  You’d be surprised how many of these half hearted attempts work and all of sudden you end up with a date with a cool and/or hot girl.  Expect to fail often, fire out a ton of messages.  Expecting to fail, instead of seeking your dream girl or lay, will help you maintain your energy.

9.	**Don’t burn out**
All these false starts, all this emotional energy, and time meeting up/messaging can be exhausting.  A lot of people just get tired and start to hate the site.  Take breaks if you need to, but keeping putting in the work, you’ll get better at it.

10.	**This will make you better**
I would have loved to meet a girl to spend/share quality time with.  I didn’t (or haven’t yet).  However, I did get alot better at the process of dating, talking with women, and knowing what I wanted.  It made me far more confident with women and I started approaching far more offline women.  I started to actually know what I want and appreciate in women.  I realized what I was worth and that I am capable of getting quality women.  I learned to control my mind and tendency to project.  I learned to expect failure, approach often, and not sell myself short.  It gave me hope that there are actually are far more interesting, hot, single women out there than I believed before.  I wish I would have tried it before now (at 24).  Life’s just too short to go through constant dry spells.  

You’ll have to go make your own mistakes and learn a lot of this for yourself, but I hope my experience can help.

edit: 
11. **Be playful**
I've done this one too many times not to mention.  I write these long serious messages with really forward compliments.  I think I thought I was showing that I was ""confident"" but given the success rates of these messages, I'm pretty sure it just comes off as overly serious and/or impatient.  I got impatient because I've been through so many interactions that I want to get right to the point, but it probably seems like I'm jumping the gun to them (or they have just lost interest).  Keep it light and fun.  Don't move too fast.

She says she goes back and forth on God.  When I heard that I couldn't help thinking ""How old are you and do you seriously still believe in fairy tales?""

I think a few books on religion/God would probably do her a lot of good because at some level she is an atheist.  She is kind of de facto a Christian because that's how she was raised.

I just want her to be able to admit that she does not believe in God.  She says she rarely thinks about the concept, but to me it seems that she only holds on to it because she is afraid of the concept of no God.  

I love her and I want her to be as rational as possible.  I feel like a great weight will be lifted from her shoulders if she were to admit to herself that she does not believe in God...

...so does anyone have some book suggestions for me to give her for Christmas?  I plan on getting two anti-theist books and one novel so that it doesn't seem like I am ""attacking"" her.  I'm leaning towards The God Delusion as one of them, which I have read in part but because I was already an atheist the arguments were very obvious to me.  I'm also thinking about God is not Great, although I haven't read it.  A book that shows the really bad side of the bible and religion in general would be a good one, I think.

forces can be kept loyal by being given a higher standard of life than that of the average worker, and this is made easier by every step in the degradation of ordinary labor. Thus the very evils of the system help to give it stability. Apart from external pressure, there is no reason why such a regime should not last for a very long time.

Well, I seriously fell off the wagon for Thanksgiving, and I jumped up to about 218.  Eep!  Then I hopped back on the wagon and started a [blog](http://glennarochelle.blogspot.com/) on December 2.  Then I fell back off a little bit during pre-finals and finals week (I didn't work out at all, but I did keep eating consciously, even though I didn't count all of my calories), and didn't keep up with my blog.  But now I'm on break, and I am back on the wagon until I reach my goal!  I weighed in this morning at 207.4!  Going off of my official start weight of 216 (how much I weighed at the start of the blog), I have lost 8.6 pounds in 19 days.  Not too shabby, eh?  Hopefully that number will skyrocket between now and when I go back to school on January 10th.

Anyway, in my haste to get home, I forgot to pack the few workout DVDs that I have :/  So, what are your favorite torrentable workouts (I'm broke, and in a podunk little town that probably doesn't have any stores in which I might find passable workout DVDs even if I had money, haha)?  I just got my hands on Jillian Michaels 30 Day Shred, so I'll definitely be doing that, but I get really bored doing the same workout day in and day out if I don't have some other things to throw in there.  Suggestsions?

Also, good luck to everyone in this, the season of cookies, brownies and encouraged seconds, thirds and fourths!  We can do it!!!

    * 1: Why did your household decide to take in foster children? Our company is under a larger company that provides services to the needy. It was just another service that the company decided to start. 
    * 2: How many children did you foster total? How many at one time? What age ranges and for how long a duration? I think I've had about 40 different children since I have been working at the group home.
    * 3: Do you keep in contact with any of the foster kids? If not, why not? Some of the ones who have aged out do keep in contact with us as an organisation but on a personal level it is not allowed due to privacy. Generally the younger clients who are reunified with their parents don't have much contact with us once they go home, mostly due to privacy.
    * 4: Which foster kid do you remember most fondly? Due to privacy I can't give names but we had a child that was very sweet and cooperative in her case plan. She made good grades and was helpful to all children and staff. 
    * 5: Which foster kid was the most disruptive or the biggest problem? I had a early teenage girl who had an obsession with becoming pregnant. Finally she did become pregnant. Because psychotropic medications can cause birth defects she was smart enough to refuse her medication. On the flip side though, she was very mentally unstable and ended up assaulting staff. 
    * 6: What was your biggest source of frustration with the foster care system? Other staff undermining my directions. Also, the kids are spoiled and get way too much from the system. In fact, they get so much that by the time they are out they think they are entitled to brand name clothes, ipod touches, food and free rent and feel they do not have to work.
    * 7: What did the foster kids like the most about your home? Probably that we have a normalcy policy. Basically the kids are allowed to go on dates, go to the movies, and have cell phones. Even earn an allowance of $20.00 per week. 
    * 8: What did the foster kids dislike the most about your home? Probably that there were lots of schedules to cater to and that they could not get exactly what they wanted when they wanted it.  
    * 9: What was a funny or interesting event involving the system? Not really.
    * 10: What do you think the tenth question should be? Explain why, and also answer it. Sorry no further suggestions.

193716,"Dear Grooveshark,

Since my discovery of you recently, you've had an impact on the way I listen
to music. While not perfect, your simplicity and accessiblity allows for 
multi-platform, cloud-based and instant (well, we'll come to that shortly) access
to millions of songs. More songs than I'd probably ever wish to listen to.

This is almost perfect for me. I work on different operating systems,
multiple platforms and in various locations. It's not practical for me to 
carry a music collection around with me in some way that doesn't need
a lots of maintainence.

Grooveshark satisfies my entertainment while I'm home on Windows,
while I'm traveling to and from work on my Android device and while I'm at work
using Ubuntu Linux. And should I find myself on another platform, or a friends
machine? There's the free web-based client, of course.

Now, you may well have deduced from the above that I am indeed a paying customer,
since I have the luxury of using the Android app. I'm previously a VIP customer, but
now some other incarnation of which I am unfamiliar after your recent 
overhaul of available packages.

I was happy to hand out $3/month for my account in return for such an adaptable
service. But now you leave me with little incentive to remain, as I seek out
alternative means to easily listen to music on my Android device--the last feature
which ties me to your otherwise degrading pay service.

With the admirable introduction of your HTML-based web client, you see, you advanced
your free service far beyond the capabilities of your VIP service.

The web interface, like a mollycoddled call-girl in a middle-class neigbourhood
is clean, sexy and approachable.

The site itself: responsive and now stable in environments with otherwise flaky 
Flash support.^[1]

And most importantly, the service runs invariably. That is to say, whenever I 
log in, I am not presented with the error messages and service outages 
that I am frequently given on the Air-based client, and sometimes the 
Android client.^[2]

Whether it's an ""unknown radio error"" or an ""error communicating with Grooveshark""
or some other such vague and description-lacking banner sent almost certainly to
do nothing but frustrate, or to annoy; it's not to say that any and all service
downtime is unnaceptable by default.
 
No; the service down-time would be accetable, if after my frustrating attempts to
fire up desktop client, I were not able to quickly open up my web browser and find
the sexy web-based whore, legs in the air, receiving custom and running just fine.

So, tell me, Grooveshark; what possible reason have I got to stay? I'll forego the
$30 I paid for my years worth of VIP service, that isn't the primary issue. I'm
talking strictly usability and service here. 

Private BitTorrent trackers such as Waffles.fm and What.CD have gotten the service
right already--and have had it right for years. Passionate music lovers who make
up the users of such sites are often able to  release perfect quality copies of 
an album even before the distributor is able to.

Not questioning the morality of using such a service, it far out-performs any of
the tried alternatives out there, of which I need not delve fully into.

I once thought of services such as Grooveshark--and Grooveshark especially--as 
the shining light in the otherwise murky pile of shit that is the 
consumer-supported music industry, providing an alternative to buying music. 
But now I'm forced to return to my ship, don my hat and eye-patch, and 
ride the wavy seas of piracy once again.

Maybe I'll see you again down the line, Grooveshark. And instead of the once 
weak-legged calf I knew you as, you'll be a sterdy bull upon which I may gloriously
ride into the rodeo of music consumption.

Signed,

A fed-up redditor.

the difference by removing the entirity of the UI and leaving Flash to perform

I'm a 23-year old bachelor who doesn't currently see this in my immediate future, but when I do head in that direction (i.e. marriage), then I feel like I would ask the father's permission in advance, if it were at all practical.  It wouldn't be binding if he said no, but it would be a way that I would attempt to develop a positive relationship with my bride-to-be's parents.

Clearly this is a tradition that has continued in society even though women are no longer seen as the property of their father, to be given to the suitor, and yet I feel that there still is a certain amount of protectiveness by the father for the daughter that is still upholding it.  So does it still have value?

About a month after that, a collection agency calls to say I owe $160 still. I ask why and they explained that the original up front fee was for the equipment, and the charge now was for the diagnosis or something. Fine, whatever. I paid it. 

Now, in December, another agency calls (I think it's different from the other company though the lady talked really fast and there seemed to be a lot of background noise or static) saying they represent the hospital and I have a charge of $50 unpaid. I asked what for and explained a few times that I paid upfront and then later at the first collection agency. She said that one visit can get three different charges at different times. She would not say specifically WHAT the money was for. 

Tomorrow I'm going to go straight to the hospital and demand answers. However, I get the feeling I'm going to get non-answers in return.

&gt;Guydyke refers to a biologically male person who feels a strong romantic or erotic attraction towards lesbians, bisexual women, or lesbian culture. / In queer subcultures a lesbian-identified male is called guydyke.

What. Can someone help me understand this? 

Yes, I realize this is ignorant, but when I think of guydykes/male lesbians, I think of cis men (not sure why I think of cis men!) that are attracted to lesbians - which, to me, is the same thing as being straight. I'm sure there are guydykes out there that are not straight/not cis, but..

I just can't wrap my head around the idea of a cis man identifying as a lesbian. I thought the definition of lesbian was 'women who are attracted to other women' so my brain short circuits when I hear ""male lesbian"" or any equivalent.. and then I think, ""Well, I'm attracted to women. Should I start calling myself a straight man?"" which is utterly ridiculous, I know.

I realize that men are often attracted to lesbianism and lesbians in general, but to actually identify as a lesbian? Gender and sexuality are fluid, etc. etc. but I *just don't understand this.*

196044,"So I found Gilksy's PS3 reflow YLOD fix and thought I would give it a try. Some backstory first. I went back to school this past semester and after a little argument with my parents over gaming habits we decided it was definitely for the better to leave my PS3 at home. The very next day once I'm all unpacked and settled in I get a phone call. Turns out my sister left my PS3 on playing a blu-ray all night in an enclosed entertainment cabinet. It died, and only shows me the yellow light of death followed with the steady red blinking light. 

So when I got home I tried everything I could find online. Hard drive formatting, resetting over and over. PS3 debug menu. Nothing worked, thing never turned on past going to a yellow light then red. So I had heard about Gilksy's YLOD fix, figure I had nothing left to lose so why not. 

After many hours of taking apart the PS3 meticulously, and using a heat gun to reflow the soder under the cpu and gpu, I put the bad boy together and plugged it in. Crossed my fingers, turn it on and OMG the light stayed green. I'm overjoyed, but skeptical, I wait a little longer. Sure enough, no less than 15 seconds later it goes back to yellow then red. 

All that time spent and no luck at all. Looks like I'll be w.o PS3 for christmas. Thank you Sony for making these units in china. I appreciate the 600$ you took for a 'top of the line' product, and now expect me to pay $150 more dollars to get it repaired. 

Only good thing to come of this is that my dads friend tried to fix it before. He said the third chip inside wasn't getting power. That third chip I figured out later was the PS2 chip. I gave the reflow fix a try just to make sure it wasn't the CPU and GPU that overheated and desoldered. So ya, looks like the ps2 chip is the culprit after all. Not starting up after checking to see if its active is why it stayed green for a little while.

Lily Sloane: No money? You mean, you don't get paid?

So i turn on my laptop, search for a wireless network enter my WAP2 key and im connected.. However...

And say i wake up in the morning and turn my laptop on, it wont connect at all. even tho i can see the wireless network on my laptop.

* The distance between my router and Laptop is approx 10 meters, and our house is of brick construction.

* There are no other electrical devices next to the router (as in cordless land line)

* The wireless router in question is a **D-LINK DIR-615 wireless N router**

* My laptop is an **Acer Aspire 1650** with a **Intel(R) PRO/wireless 2200BG network connection** - its about 4 years old now.

I take Lithium for (vaguely alluded to/sort-of diagnosed) Bipolar II, and had been put on Lexapro a few weeks ago, but stopped about a week and a half ago due to horrible somnolence that had me falling asleep at the wheel.

I don't blame the Lexapro, since it didn't even have time to really build up in my system, but today was like a really mild mini-mania of some strange kind. Or maybe just a day that I WASN'T depressed and felt exceptionally energized.

My door ice dispenser started acting up this weekend. After releasing the pedal to get ice it was retracting more slowly than usual and making a pretty nasty squeeking sounds while doing so. Did some digging, pulled the thing apart and found what was wrong. The plunger type device that slows the door-flap down as it closes wasn't moving smoothly (picture [here](http://www.repairclinic.com/PartDetail/Large-Part-Image?imgID=886974&amp;locID=2948), lower left piece). Pulled it out, looked it over, reseated it and now it will not move under the pressure of the spring in the door at all. In hand I can pull hard enough to get it to move (it comes apart, just a plunger w/ gasket and a cup) but the spring in the door doesn't come close. Pulled it apart again, washed everything, lubed it with silicon and still nothing. Repeated the process with WD40, still no movement. 

Apparently you can only get the part with the rest of the kit pictured above which is $50.

200571,"This is a (not especially) long story, but the question is rather simple, so if you don't feel like reading, just scroll to the TLDR.

So I've been planning to build a PC for a while. On my way home for Christmas I stopped at a Microcenter en route to buy most of my components. I had already bought a graphics card via Newegg during Black Friday, but when I reached the store (hundreds of miles from my place in Virginia) I realized I had left the card at home. Eager to build my rig, I decided to buy another graphics card in store in hopes of returning one or the other. I'm on a bit of a tight time table to return the card to Newegg however, as I won't be back for weeks.

Then I get home and find out my mom's getting the kids a new computer from Christmas. Fortunately I find this out right in time to tell her to cancel the deal so I can just build her one for way cheaper; thing is now I'm thinking maybe I'll just add the graphics card I'd bought earlier to the mix. It'd make their computer into a solid gaming rig, which I'm sure would make my younger brother very happy, especially since our (my) Xbox broke while I was out of town. I was planning on buying at least some graphics card, but probably something pretty low-end for their system. Right now though I'm really just looking to see if I can find a really cheap card to hold them until I can come home and put in the card I bought earlier.

Other times it is clear that the tank is simply bad at their role and cannot hold aggro off of me.

It is pretty maddening when you wait 30 minutes to get into a dungeon though, only to either have the group wipe once and disband, or to be kicked for some ridiculous reason.

202109,"Some of you may remember that for a year or two after the Nintendo Wii became available in the US, they were difficult to find in stores and often sold on eBay for $100+ above retail.

One day, as a high school sophomore, I went to Sam's Club for the midnight release of Super Smash Brothers Brawl. As I walked up to the checkout counter, the cashier asked if I also wanted to buy a Wii. I already owned one, but I accepted this offer, thinking I could resell for a nice profit.

The next day at school I told some friends I bought a Wii and was selling it on eBay, hoping to make $100. A classmate (somewhere between acquaintance and casual friend) overheard this conversation, walked up to me, and asked if I would end my auction and sell him the Wii directly - for exactly the retail price plus tax.

He asked twice, politely but with palpable desperation. I declined since he refused to even compensate me for the effort of buying it. When he left, my friends said I should have simply sold it to him without any markup, ""just to be nice,"" in their words. I was very confused. Yes, if I sold it I would be ""nice"" but wouldn't I also be letting him walk all over me? He wasn't a very close friend; matter of fact, he was often rude to me at times. Selling him this Wii would not further our friendship in any way.

If he were a close friend of mine, I would have been happy to make this transaction. But we weren't close at all. Nonetheless, my IRL friends think I should have done it. How about you, redditors?

Needless to say I am a little bit disappointed at this development so I begin going through the motions of trying to debug the problem. Reinstalled both my video and sound drivers, disabled AVG, unistalled AVG no changes. 

It was not until I disabled most of background processes did the problem go away. However, it was at the cost of my sound. I narrowed the problem down to the ""Power' background process if its the only one disabled then TF2 gets 100-50 FPS. Likewise, if it is the only enabled process TF2 get 20-15 FPS no question.

I have tried putting in a question to steam but so far no response and I don't where else to go to post this to get the best answer so I turn to the members of the tf2 subredddit in the hopes of making any progress towards a solution to this ridiculous problem

205047,"Hi Reddit,

I have somewhat of a problem, let me start with a back story.  

Around January 2006 I started leasing a server from a company called aHosting which no longer exists.  I made monthly payments to the server company for 3 years for $184/month.  In December 2009, I called up the company (aHosting) and asked them to suspend my services as I found a new host that was cheaper.  Come May 2010, aHosting got bought out by bHosting.  

Now for the problem, for some reason bHosting continued to bill me, and also never notified me 
of the buyout.  It wasn't until October 2010 that I got an email saying I was **5 months** past due on billing and they were **billing me for unpaid invoices**.

**I replied almost immediately with this email:**
&gt;I canceled my service with your company back when it was aHosting. I didn't even know that your company changed names so these emails kept getting marked as spam.

&gt;One of your employers cancelled my account via phone on my last billing period I paid.  I haven't used that server since. 

&gt;Please cancel my account and verify with me it is at mynew@emailaddress.com

**To which they replied:**
&gt;Thank you for your reply.  We have updated our records accordingly.
&gt;Let us know if you have any questions.
&gt;bHosting Billing

I thought everything was fine and they realized I had canceled my account with aHosting.  That was the last I heard from them until this morning when a collection agency contacted me about money I owe to bHosting.  He left me a voicemail saying that he dispatched a private investigator to my house and that no one was home.  He was lying out of his teeth.

I called him back and the phone call this morning went something like this.  You owe us $900 and if you pay by the end of the day it will we can settle at $700. 
If I couldn't he told me I was going to have to hire a lawyer and go to court in Seattle, WA (I live in NY). 

This guy from the collection agency was hassling me to pay as quick as I could and I told him I couldn't because I don't have the $700.

The collection agency is [Cory G. Hicks &amp; Associates](http://www.google.com/search?source=ig&amp;hl=en&amp;rlz=&amp;q=Cory+G.+H+%26+Associates&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;aq=f&amp;oq=#hl=en&amp;expIds=17050,25657,26486,26488,26492,26496,26504,27339,27642,27887,27951&amp;sugexp=ldymls&amp;xhr=t&amp;q=%22Cory+G.+Hicks+%26+Associates%22&amp;cp=14&amp;pf=p&amp;sclient=psy&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=&amp;aql=&amp;oq=%22Cory+G.+Hicks+%26+Associates%22&amp;gs_rfai=&amp;pbx=1&amp;fp=ca05a7bb65e82229) and after googling them you’ll come to find out that they aren’t best of people.  They use scare tactics and extortion in order for people to pay them.

I want to refrain from posting the Server Hosting company but I might if some wants to know.

Could anyone offer me some advice on what to do.  My dad has lawyers and can fight this but I want to know for sure that if I was going to court I would win.  I'm a bit scared because of the off chance the Judge sides with the collection agency. I'm a broke ass kid without much money and would hate to be furthur in debt.

**TL;DR** I was hosting a server on a company, and canceled my services with the company over the phone.  A few months later a company buys out that company and continues to bill me for $184 without me knowing for **5 months**.  I got a voicemail this morning from a collection agency asking for $900 to pay them back. Advice???

It's exasperating. It really is the most frustrating thing ever to see some crazy ass build, respond accordingly and then have something like 30 reapers appear in my allies base (which is not shared).

As a child I developed a tendency towards acts of extreme cruelty however developed a belief that goodness is something to strive towards.

I have been able to accept for a long time that I used to be prone to cruel acts and harming those around me, however still deny to myself that this condition is current.

I fear death more than anything else, so suicide has never really been an option (though in truth I have tried through acts of wanton disregard and when thoroughly inebriated).

I crave the attention of others, and revel in admiration and fear, so this prevents social isolation (though throughout my life i have dreamed of a life off the grid with only myself).

I despise restriction and rebel against convention and authority at every opportunity (however on occasion will encourage others in the development of regulation and structure).

I lie constantly.

I become obssessed easily and find myself often chasing what I know is unreachable.

I don't truly believe in anything.

It makes me feel sick that my will can be so weak, I will often take this out on others if they are around.

I often try to shift others perspective of reality to give myself an ego boost.

I sink myself in tv, books, music, fantasy and to distract myself from the shame of my reality.

I dream big, and achieve little.

I have been depressed for years and finally got diagnosed in college. Most of my friends know but I haven't told my family. Most days are about even, I go about my day like tralalalala and then I sleep. Some days I feel so giddy and happy I just want to dance and be with my friends. Others are much, much darker, I stay in my room, play games, watch tv and smoke weed (it numbs the pain). I can do this for days and even weeks without much movement. 
I also get awful insomnia when I'm depressed. Last semester of last year I broke up with my girlfriend and failed my exams. I failed the whole year and my parents think I was just being lazy. IDK I just can't bear telling them, as if it is admitting something shameful to them. I spent my time staying up and doing nothing really, I got to 4 or so days before I passed out on my bed.
Currently I have no job, I am living with my parents, I have so much college I fear I may fail and drop out but the fear is paralysing me from working as hard as I'd like (When I get some huge deadline or project I run from it like fight or flight reaction), so that makes me a coward, I am so lonely I feel like crying (I push it deep down which I've been told is really bad), I have no discernible skills or attributes and I'm ugly and weird.

This prompted me to do a google search for ""age of the ocean floor"".  For example [this page from about.com](http://geology.about.com/library/bl/maps/blseafloorage.htm) from a mainstream site portraying a mainstream point of view.  Shows the color coded diagram of the age of the ocean floor.
Oldest ocean floor is in blue, newest in red, with green and yellow in between.

The mainstream point of view is also stated at about.com saying that a large amount of the ocean floor is reycled.

Intuitively, the diagram didn't seem consistent with the recycled theory.  Then I decided to look at it in detail.  If the plates are expanding in the Atlantic, and being subducted in the Pacific, then one would expect the Pacific plates to be very old and the Atlantic ones to be very new.  But that is not the case.  They're both new.

There remains one last possibility.  That the subduction/ocean floor creation process alternates, first happening at one end, then going in the other direction.  This possibility can also be discounted because the newest ocean floor (red) is next to the medium age ocean floor (green,yellow), and farthest away from the oldest ocean floor. If the plates were going back and forth, the oldest part of the ocean floor would have to be right next to the some of the youngest without something in between.

In conclusion, just by looking at a widely available map of the ocean floor, its possible to conclude that the earth is expanding.  I was a bit shocked to learn this, and that the info would be so out in the open.

Of course, the also very interesting question:  where is the extra matter coming from?  Outer space?  Or is it being 'generated' somehow inside the earth, meaning there is no conservation of mass?

It turns reddish (swollen veins in the eye) and shifting focus hurts (especially from and to reading distance). It always surges in from a side to the rest of the eye(it's red on one side first and a couple of hours later my whole eye is red). This lasts 1.5 day before it returns to normal. During all this I can see everything perfectly clear.

I have been to several eye-specialists (We have an eye-hospital in Rotterdam/Netherlands) and they really have no clue as to why and what.

In the beginning(started feb. 2009) it was a dead-on accurate cycle: once in two weeks starting friday and ending sunday. Lately the intervals are getting longer: I got it again today while the last time was around 8 november.

Ruled out:

- Infection or Conjunctivitis(most online diagnosis point to this one), they tested on several infections (even with a couple of bloodtests).

- Allergy. The specialist agreed that if it would manifest in one eye, it also would in the other.

- glaucoma

- high eye-pressure. Didn't knew it exists untill the test itself.

- Air humidity problems (I had gels to apply to avoid a dry eye)

- Dust

- Overstrained circular muscles. I once had to try and keep reading and shifting focus all day long in order to determine if it would prolong the interval. Nope, just 1.5 days.

I have:

- no glasses

- eye strength is around +0.5 both

- no diabetes

- no spiked bloodpressure

The docs are out of all options and plainly have no clue.
I recently returned, because I saw a deadpixel (black spot in my eyesight) in my righteye but it turned to be a proteine crystal which dissolves hopefully *in a couple of years*. 
When he saw it he rallied up some students and other docs to show it how it looks like (it's quite rare in younger people). The other docs immediately said:""Ah, you keep on bringing the mysteries with your righteye"".

I've read through [Coffee Geek](http://www.coffeegeek.com) and [Coffee Review](http://www.coffeereview.com). I've looked up local roasters and even read some articles on home roasting.



Through all of this, I have decided 2 things.
1. I want to drink awesome coffee at home. 
2. I don't want to be a coffee snob - it just costs too damn much!



I had a french press for a while, but had no clue how the hell to use it, and well it was kind of broken because I had gotten it at Salvation Army. I asked my hubby to fix it, which he did then I looked up [How to use a French Press](http://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+use+a+french+press&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a). Yesterday I made my first pot of french press coffee. It was wonderful!


I did a little bit more research into using a French Press, and found that the key to amazing French Press coffee is having a uniform course grind. The kind of grind you get from [a Burr Mill grinder](http://www.google.com/search?q=A+burr+mill+grinder&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a#q=A+burr+mill+grinder&amp;hl=en&amp;safe=active&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;hs=DDl&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;prmd=ivns&amp;source=univ&amp;tbs=shop:1&amp;tbo=u&amp;ei=PwwSTbbNOZKtngebh9mqDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=product_result_group&amp;ct=title&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CFIQrQQwAg&amp;biw=1258&amp;bih=425&amp;fp=9bef8cda26d1a6ec).

210979,"Do you ever find yourself needing a container where you have a key inside the element?  

Say... something like this:

    struct Pos
    {
      int ID;
      double x, y;
    }

And you want the key to be ID.  Using a map would duplicate the key.  And using a set (either with custom comparison predicate or a less than operator in Pos) means you can't search by ID.  You can only search by the entire Pos structure where you would set the ID to search for.

I've recently released a skiplist container library and have added a new style container that acts like a map, but where you can define a custom accessor predicate to retrieve the key from the value.  It'd be something like this:

    struct PosAccess {
      int operator()(const Pos &amp;p) const {return p.ID;}
    }
    
    AccessSkipList&lt;int,Pos,PosAccess&gt; PosList;

So now the element is Pos type, but the key is Pos::ID.

I can't be the only one who runs into this all the time, am I?  What are your solutions when the key is also in the element itself?  I'm talking about times when you can't remove the key from the element.  My library aside, would you find a container that works in such a way to be useful?

This also goes for those who those who hate the idea of a national health care system. These people are wrong ( I believe) but they are also totally obstinate and have been successful in keeping us from achieving any progress.  I propose that we allow these people off the hook, or at least give them the same tax breaks and welfare that we would allow for any disabled person. Although it would cost those of us who understand the need for progressive taxes and strong social safety nets more money, in exchange we would secure the ability to enact strong programs that would benefit society as a whole. As an added bonus, we could could all give all our conservative relatives a lot of shit about what a drain they are on society when we are visiting for Thanksgiving dinner. 

TLDR; Modern day pirates on the high seas have shown us that in reality, sometimes it's more efficient to just pay the hostage takers and get on with business. I propose we ""pay off"" conservatives who hate liberal ideas in the same way so we can get on with the business of building a better society. 

EDIT: Here's one way to possibly achieve something approaching this proposal. Have a national referendum where Americans are asked to opt in to a ""patriot tax"" or ""social program tax"". This would be sort of like a national fundraiser for social programs. Say you wanted to enact a national health care system that would cost X amount of dollars. Americans could be asked to opt in to pay a little extra in their taxes to pay for it. You could cap the amount paid in at some reasonable rate. If enough people opted in to cover the programs' costs, the program could move forward. If the threshold does not get reached then the tax is not enacted and the program does not move forward.   I am just throwing ideas out here.  Say the program is a huge success, more people might decide to do the right thing and opt in. Those who opt out but utilize the programs WOULD be bloodsucking on our awesome system but that would just be something we'd have to be willing to live with. 

EDIT: I'm realizing that it's probably not a good idea to go about this by calling people who opted out to be mentally disabled. The fact is we have an immense divide in this country over how taxes should work and what they should accomplish. I'm proposing that we start looking for ideas and proposals for our tax system that addresses the divide and try to come up with something that everyone could agree on. If the conservative position is ""I don't want to pay any taxes for social programs"" and there's no practical way to let them opt out without letting them enjoy the benefits, then maybe those of us who want social programs have to prove how much we want them by being willing even to pay for those who don't.

I leaned down to see a plastic box mounted next to the paper bags that was being used to collect money for a local food bank. I asked him if he knew what the money in the box was for and he replied no. I explained it was to help buy food for people who couldn’t afford any.

My impression over the internet is that people subscribing to atheism believe there is NO God. They revel in their own rationality and logical mind without realizing that the statement ""there is no God"", shows just as much misguided faith as the statement ""there is a God"". 

The logical mind finds it very hard to come to the conclusion that supernatural entities exist due to the lack of scientific evidence. I do, however, challenge any poster here to explain their existence, or even some of the scientific 'fact; that they rely so heavily upon. The fact is we [the scientific community] do not know WHY or even HOW we are here. Where did we come from? What will happen to my consciousness when I [my body] die? Why is gravity as weak as it is? What created the fundamental laws that govern our universe?

The fact that believers attribute these to a God, is why - I believe - most atheists become atheists. They see the lack of logic or understanding in becoming a believer, and instantly say there is no evidence so there can't be a God. But since there are still fairly profound unanswered questions, this is just as unreasonable.

Until science HAS provided all of the answers to life, the universe and everything then Atheism is just as much a religion as Christianity or Islam. Atheism still displays a belief system, because of the unanswered questions - which is the illogical statement that makes atheists feel superior to believers.

Am I the only one who thinks she didn't die at the end?  

The entire film seems to me to be a metaphor for growing up.  Nina must find joy in what she's doing for herself - not her mom, not anyone else.  She has to get out of her sheltered child-like mindset and live her life and grow into a woman.  This is exemplified by the transformation into the Black Swan.  She is stepping out from underneath her mother's shelter and control and becoming her own person.  She is becoming a woman.  The transformation is complete by the end of the film. 

Also, the movie works as a metaphor for being an artist and creating art.  She has to find what is beautiful and meaningful for her.  She throws herself into her work so strongly that it affects her life outside of the performance (Heath Ledger?).  

I thought the film worked as a narrative within the film, but also on greater levels (like the two I just mentioned).  For this reason I find it to be one of the best films of the year.  This is how I interpreted the movie as I was watching it, so I was fascinated to discover upon reading others' reactions that so many people are on the ""she died at the end"" side of the fence.  

I'd love to hear some of your thoughts.

tl;dr Does anyone else think she didn't die? The movie is a metaphor for growing up and also for creating art, not entirely literal.",-1,-1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I resorted to using a cork from a wine bottle. I cut a bowl into one end, and a mouthpiece and shotgun into the bowl. I didn't have any weed to try it with, but I gave it an experimental suck and it tastes AMAZING. The air inside it tastes exactly like the wine it was from.

I'm really excited to try it soon, but I'm worried that it will catch flame when I try to smoke from it. So my question is: Are there any ways I can make it flame retardant, is it safe right now to smoke from, or should i just not use it?

But the truth is the exact opposite, for all the people I have known and met in the anime scene are intelligent, fun and take care of how they look and work hard for their future and dreams. They are extremely successful, talented and more social than any regular folk I have known in my life.

The bad reputation that anime fans have of being failures and socially awkward have made the majority of people who are not into anime look at anime and its fans as failures. That's why every time I tell someone that I'm into anime they give me the look of disapproval, and I dislike that.

You can't be an anime fan without being judged and looked at like a freak by the majority of society.

Personally, I'm not a fan of outing anyone, even if they are a bigoted piece of shit.  Even if they are someone who is obviously gay.  Coming out is an incredibly personal thing to do, and in this world it is still something that not everyone is comfortable doing.

Before I came out, I would have been mortified if anyone had outed me, if anyone had drug me out of the closet.  I wish that the world was more understanding and that people felt more empowered to be who they really are in an open manner.  But we have a ways to go before that happens.

Like I said, I view coming out as a very personal thing to do.  It is huge, it is a massive thing for someone to do.  It has to do with their sense of identity, and that is up for the individual to decide, not other people.

I am only in charge of my life.  I am not and cannot be in charge of yours.  I cannot be the one that deals with the consequences of you being out of the closet, that is something that only you can deal with.  I think that if someone isn't ready to be out yet, then they shouldn't be forced to be out.  But I can work to make the world a better and more understanding place, and I can be and advocate for all LGBTQ people everywhere and hopefully empower them to be able to make that decision in their life.

Both of us are open with each other and other friends about our sex lives. Except, nobody we know talks about what the two of us do, not even us.

217700," This expansion (just like I did in WotLK) I swore to myself my Shammy would finally be able to live out his Enhancement dreams. He would smash faces and shoot lightning bolts from his fingertips! He would savage his foes with the might of the almighty elements! 

Only he didn't. 

Once again he is healing. He is doing his duty and filling the gaping vacuum of healers currently present in Azeroth. 

Sure we was able to level as Enh. He enjoyed it immensely. For some reason he just can't stay DPS

When he was 10 he dreamed of crushing his enemies with mighty hammers. At 42 (due to a patch that left him talentless) he began his journey as a healer. His success at healing in TBC was quite impressive.

All the while though inside he had the gnawing feeling he had missed out on his true purpose.

Lich King came and again he grabbed a weapon in each hand and swung his way to level 80! Alas, the siren call of healing began again to call his name.

Resist as he might he couldn't deny that his path down the road of a healer was the right thing to do and he put his weapons of war to rest once again.

At this point you may be able to guess his current plight now that the Cataclysm has arrived.

Do you play a role even though deep down you know your toon was born to do something else?

What has kept you from sticking to that deep desire?

Are you happy when you play a role well even if it isn't what you would choose?

Some recent games I remember: I was playing as MF and my team comp was fairly decent (i can only remember Garen and GP), on the other team the main damage dealers were all AP: Vlad, Karthus and another one. Nobody bought magic resist except me and we lost.

Another game I was playing Malphite and laning with Lux vs a Twitch &amp; Mundo. We're doing pretty good, lux buys some wards for Twitch, i take some cleavers from Mundo for her and we're almost taking their tower down when things start going wrong. Our last pick, a Heimer (the other team was Panth, TF, Mundo, Twitch, MF) starts dieing a couple of times. Some of us start giving him some advice, some tell him about his mother and that he doesn't belong in ranked and he just starts walking into the enemy team. He manages to get a nice 0-10-1 and we lose AGAIN.

I'm not sure if this is what people call ELO hell or not but I'm sure it all started with me queue dodging.

Can we influence change in the policy at all?

I did some searching inside this book and found no mention of regular expressions, for example, and only one mention of xml. Searches for GTK, or GUI, return nothing. I am unsure whether this is because these things are not covered or whether the search on Amazon sucks.

I have a rule. Tell me the rules and as long as they are equitable and just, I'll play by them. Don't tell me the rules and as far as I'm concerned you are allowed to make them up as you go along. In college people would chastise me for  not cutting across the grass, when the signs clearly said, ""Stay off the Grass""

I understood that if everybody walked on the grass, there would be no grass. I like grass. I appreciate that people work hard for very little money to make it look good. So I don't walk on it, when I am asked not to.

But nobody has told me the rules for ATMs. I just got ""chastised"" by the golfing guy in sunglasses. I'm at the Mall. I drive over the ATM. The parking lot is full, cars everywhere. In close proximity to the ATM is a mail box and a little farther away is a bank.

There is one guy getting money and cars sitting at a distance from the ATM like plastic hyenas.

I don't know who is coming, who is leaving, who is using the mail box, who is on their lunch break from the Mall, who is getting a hand job from a local hooker, who is on their cell, who is having a suicidal Christmas crying jag and who is getting money. So I figure, I'll do the thing I came here to do, get money.

As soon as the man in front of me leaves, I step up to the machine. Mr. Golf Outing gets out of his car and yells sarcastically: ""You do realize we were all in line for that machine?""

I turned and replied: ""No, I'm the only person who was in line.""

He said: ""People don't like it when you stand behind them when they are getting money. Everybody knows that.""  Luckily I refrained from saying the first thing that popped into my mind which was *Unless they are close enough to check my prostate, I don't tend to mind.* and settled for the second thing instead, which was: ""What I know is, if you are too lazy to stand out in the cold, it's not my problem."" It was a frigid 50 degrees out.

""OH MERRY CHRISTMAS"" he shouted out sarcastically.

Inner voice *That's some way to show the spirit of the season, jackass.*

By this time, people had indeed started to form a queue. One of the young ladies behind me took up Mr. Golf Outing's goodwill of the season and repeated his holiday greeting, with only a little less snark ""Merry Christmas, I hope you have a good one."" And I replied, in all sincerity, ""Thank you, I hope you do too.""

By this time I had completed my business. I turned and walked back to my car.

Mr. Golf Outing said, ""Karma's a bitch."" Inner voice * Your chest beating is not impressive. If you grab a tree limb and started running through a stream, it could be more effective.... but prolly not.* (the problem with dealing with some folks is that primate anthropological references are often lost on them)

I turned to him and said, ""That actually comes closer to my religious beliefs than Christianity.""

This set his on his heels, because after that , he just kept saying things like, ""Yeah, Karma."" ""Karma will take care of you.""

Seems his knowledge of the non-Christian religions, is at least on par with his knowledge of the one he professes to follow.

So, all you polite people. Would you sit in a car and wait for an indeterminate number of people to lumber out of their cars up to the cash machine, back to their cars and do it all over again for the next 5 people? Or would you get out of your car, get in line and  then if someone moved up to the queue and politely  pointed out that they were there first,  gladly move out of the way?

224190,"So.....I'm married to a military guy.  We've be married 3 years (together 3 before we got hitched).  I have a degree and was working overseas when I met him.  I love my husband and think he's intelligent.  Some of his friends (and their wives) are great too.

But, in high school (before I went to college), I had really negative opinions about people who joined the military.  They haven't been totally dispelled since I've known more military people.  They have, in fact, been confirmed. 

So.....my husband is great.  As I mentioned, some other men and their wives are great.  I'm not talking about every military person.  There are some fantastic, intelligent people in the service.

But, (and here is the non-politically correct part) lots of them are complete idiots.  They have no idea why our country is even at war.  They don't know the objective.  They know they have a job to do and that's all. 

I don't expect them to be scholars --- but they have NO idea what they're fighting for (they can't even make one coherent sentence about it).... no idea about the history of the area... no idea about the history of the world.

I do feel like some of them are rather worthless.  They had no common sense and that's how they were recruited.  If they hadn't been recruited, they'd be mindlessly working at a factory or selling drugs (we know a few who had the choice of going to prison or joining the military).

Anyway.....I think tons of people who don't know military guys thank them for their service and really respect them.  That's not a bad thing, I guess.  Some guys are great.  And, they have put their lives on the line.  Perhaps they all deserve respect for risking their lives.  But, like I said, but I've seen such horrible things too.

I've seen a guy attempt to strangle his girlfriend at a party at our house (all the guys stepped in to stop him from doing it), but still..... WHAT?  I have never seen anything close to that in civilian life.  

I've also seen married men talk down to their wives like they were dogs.  I think it has something to do with rank and how everyone percieves themselves to be above or below someone due to rank.  Wives have no rank.  That's the best explanation I can make out.  I've never observed people be so rude to their significant others (not just 1 or 2 guys, but many of them).

Anyway.... that's my opinion (and what I've experienced) with the military.

Please share any of your opinions of the military - or other opinons you hold that you feel are not politically correct .....

Say you extend your arm out horizontally, away from your face.  Your fingers are extended, and a fly has landed on your index finger.  Immediately, you feel that sensation.  You feel it, knowing exactly that it is roughly 3/4 of a meter away from your face and a 1 3/4 meter from the ground.  

Now, think of this in a 3 dimensional aspect, what gives this sensation it's physical location in the universe? How do I know that it is this certain distance from the ground and from my face.  If I have sat down on a chair in a typical room, and then blind folded my self, I would be able to visually imagine the stimulation's location within the world at a 3-Dimensional level.

I would love to date her and hang out with her and talk to her without being held back by the thought of being flirty or creepy! Also, if she says no, it will be awkward everyday that we see eachother in Chemistry class. She is a darn good friend to have and I will fully regret saying anything if we're not friends because of that.

After speaking with her mother I explained to her I felt it was wrong and she broke our agreement about disciplining our child! She in turn got mad and accused me of basically canceling out the lesson the slap was intended to teach by telling our daughter it was wrong of her to hit her!

225196,"I recently got an e-mail forward from a friend of mine who just doesn't understand why/how I can be atheist and, while he means well, it's frustrating that he doesn't just respect and accept my atheism. Anyway, this story he sent me was an interesting one but I can't quite figure out a polite but appropriate way to respond to it:

---

A science professor begins his school year with a lecture to the students, ""Let me explain the problem science has with religion."" The atheist professor of philosophy pauses before his class and then asks one of his new students to stand.

""You're a Christian, aren't you, son?""

""Yes sir,"" the student says.

""So you believe in God?""

""Absolutely.""

""Is God good?""

""Sure! God's good.""

""Is God all-powerful? Can God do anything?""

""Yes.""

""Are you good or evil?""

""The Bible says I'm evil.""

The professor grins knowingly. ""Aha! The Bible!"" He considers for a moment. ""Here's one for you. Let's say there's a sick person over here and you can cure him. You can do it. Would you help him? Would you try?""

""Yes sir, I would.""

""So you're good...!""

""I wouldn't say that.""

""But why not say that? You'd help a sick and maimed person if you could. Most of us would if we could. But God doesn't.""

The student does not answer, so the professor continues. ""He doesn't, does he? My brother was a Christian who died of cancer, even though he prayed to Jesus to heal him. How is this Jesus good? Hmmm? Can you answer that one?""

The student remains silent.

""No, you can't, can you?"" the professor says. He takes a sip of water from a glass on his desk to give the student time to relax.

""Let's start again, young fella. Is God good?""

""Er...yes,"" the student says.

""Is Satan good?""

The student doesn't hesitate on this one. ""No.""

""Then where does Satan come from?""

The student falters. ""From God""

""That's right. God made Satan, didn't he? Tell me, son. Is there evil in this world?""

""Yes, sir.""

""Evil's everywhere, isn't it? And God did make everything, correct?""

""Yes.""

""So who created evil?"" The professor continued, ""If God created everything, then God created evil, since evil exists, and according to the principle that our works define who we are, then God is evil.""

Again, the student has no answer. ""Is there sickness? Immorality? Hatred? Ugliness? All these terrible things, do they exist in this world?""

The student squirms on his feet. ""Yes.""

""So who created them?""

The student does not answer again, so the professor repeats his question. ""Who created them?"" There is still no answer. Suddenly the lecturer breaks away to pace in front of the classroom. The class is mesmerized. ""Tell me,"" he continues onto another student. ""Do you believe in Jesus Christ, son?""

The student's voice betrays him and cracks. ""Yes, professor, I do.""

The old man stops pacing. ""Science says you have five senses you use to identify and observe the world around you. Have you ever seen Jesus?""

""No sir. I've never seen Him.""

""Then tell us if you've ever heard your Jesus?""

""No, sir, I have not.""

""Have you ever felt your Jesus, tasted your Jesus or smelt your Jesus? Have you ever had any sensory perception of Jesus Christ, or God for that matter?""

""No, sir, I'm afraid I haven't.""

""Yet you still believe in him?""

""Yes.""

""According to the rules of empirical, testable, demonstrable protocol, science says your God doesn't exist. What do you say to that, son?""

""Nothing,"" the student replies. ""I only have my faith.""

""Yes, faith,"" the professor repeats. ""And that is the problem science has with God. There is no evidence, only faith.""

The student stands quietly for a moment, before asking a question of His own. ""Professor, is there such thing as heat?""

""Yes,"" the professor replies. ""There's heat.""

""And is there such a thing as cold?""

""Yes, son, there's cold too.""

""No sir, there isn't.""

The professor turns to face the student, obviously interested. The room suddenly becomes very quiet. The student begins to explain. ""You can have lots of heat, even more heat, super-heat, mega-heat, unlimited heat, white heat, a little heat or no heat, but we don't have anything called 'cold'. We can hit up to 458 degrees below zero, which is no heat, but we can't go any further after that. There is no such thing as cold; otherwise we would be able to go colder than the lowest -458 degrees.""

""Every body or object is susceptible to study when it has or transmits energy, and heat is what makes a body or matter have or transmit energy. Absolute zero (-458 F) is the total absence of heat. You see, sir, cold is only a word we use to describe the absence of heat. We cannot measure cold. Heat we can measure in thermal units because heat is energy. Cold is not the opposite of heat, sir, just the absence of it.""

Silence across the room. A pen drops somewhere in the classroom, sounding like a hammer.

""What about darkness, professor. Is there such a thing as darkness?""

""Yes,"" the professor replies without hesitation. ""What is night if it isn't darkness?""

""You're wrong again, sir. Darkness is not something; it is the absence of something. You can have low light, normal light, bright light, flashing light, but if you have no light constantly you have nothing and it's called darkness, isn't it? That's the meaning we use to define the word.""

""In reality, darkness isn't. If it were, you would be able to make darkness darker, wouldn't you?""

The professor begins to smile at the student in front of him. This will be a good semester. ""So what point are you making, young man?""

""Yes, professor. My point is, your philosophical premise is flawed to start with, and so your conclusion must also be flawed.""

The professor's face cannot hide his surprise this time. ""Flawed? Can you explain how?""

""You are working on the premise of duality,"" the student explains. ""You argue that there is life and then there's death; a good God and a bad God. You are viewing the concept of God as something finite, something we can measure. Sir, science can't even explain a thought.""

""It uses electricity and magnetism, but has never seen, much less fully understood either one. To view death as the opposite of life is to be ignorant of the fact that death cannot exist as a substantive thing. Death is not the opposite of life, just the absence of it.""

""Now tell me, professor. Do you teach your students that they evolved from a monkey?""

""If you are referring to the natural evolutionary process, young man, yes, of course I do.""

""Have you ever observed evolution with your own eyes, sir?""

The professor begins to shake his head, still smiling, as he realizes where the argument is going. A very good semester, indeed.

""Since no one has ever observed the process of evolution at work and cannot even prove that this process is an on-going endeavor, are you not teaching your opinion, sir? Are you now not a scientist, but a preacher?""

The class is in uproar. The student remains silent until the commotion has subsided.

""To continue the point you were making earlier to the other student, let me give you an example of what I mean.""

The student looks around the room. ""Is there anyone in the class who has ever seen the professor's brain?"" The class breaks out into laughter.

""Is there anyone here who has ever heard the professor's brain, felt the professor's brain, touched or smelt the professor's brain? No one appears to have done so. So, according to the established rules of empirical, stable, demonstrable protocol, science says that you have no brain, with all due respect, sir.""

""So if science says you have no brain, how can we trust your lectures, sir?""

Now the room is silent. The professor just stares at the student, his face unreadable.

Finally, after what seems an eternity, the old man answers. ""I guess you'll have to take them on faith.""

""Now, you accept that there is faith, and, in fact, faith exists with life,"" the student continues. ""Now, sir, is there such a thing as evil?""

Now uncertain, the professor responds, ""Of course, there is. We see it everyday. It is in the daily example of man's inhumanity to man. It is in the multitude of crime and violence everywhere in the world. These manifestations are nothing else but evil.""

To this the student replied, ""Evil does not exist sir, or at least it does not exist unto itself. Evil is simply the absence of God. It is just like darkness and cold, a word that man has created to describe the absence of God. God did not create evil. Evil is the result of what happens when man does not have God's love present in his heart. It's like the cold that comes when there is no heat or the darkness that comes when there is no light.""

The professor sat down.

225284,"Hey all,

Okay, I'm a 19-year-old guy. Here's some background: my best friend, for I have a thing, is going to be staying with me for two weeks over break, and for the entire summer. She's staying with me in my dorm this break, and we're getting an apartment over summer, as we're working together at a summer camp. We have known each other since we were 14, and haven't seen each other since we were 15, but kept very much in touch, through video chat, calls, IM, text, etc. I can count the number of nights on my fingers I haven't fallen asleep talkin on the phone with her. She is beautiful beyond words and imagination, brilliant, sweet, funny, a damn good cook, and fun to be around. Honestly, the girl of my dreams. She does reciprocate my affection, btw, but we won't get into a relationship just because of the distance (which sucks, but I understand)

So, I need your advice. How do I make her happy, sexually and emotionally? I want to treat her the way I see her. She is precious beyond all words to me- I was in a bad place when I was 17, and she talked me out of it and was the only light in my life for quite a while- and I want to show her that through my actions. I see her and have an immediate need to take care of her, and protect her (although I have a feeling she wouldn't take kindly to that- she's one of the most independent and self-sufficient women I've ever met). How do I show her I care?

Sexually, I have three questions: It's pretty much accepted that at some point in these two weeks, between our Halo and CoD tourneys, and her amazing cooking, and watching movies, we are going to have sex. Probably quite a lot of it. I'm a virgin. She's a virgin. First of all, I'm 6'8, and she's 5'3, so I have a feeling that will be a major issue. I'm also a pretty built guy, and even though she's fit, she's still only 110lbs. Secondly, I don't know how to foreplay, or make her happy at all, or how slow to take it but still make it so she doesn't get bored. Finally, I have no idea what the hell to do. Yea, I've watched porn. But I know that stuff isn't real, so I still have no idea. So how do I make this good and not painful for her? This can be the best two weeks of my life (how often does a dorky software engineering student have a smart, sexy girl move in with them for two weeks? All the time- in engineering student's dreams) and I want to make them good for her too.... so help?

**EDIT**: I also need some help for being with her in an everyday sort of way- she's going to be here for 2 weeks, and about all I can think of to do is play video games/ go to the library. This is because I am boring and have no life. ",-1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

225796,"My SO(18) and I(21) are madly in love with each other. We've only been together a month, and i know that it's not a long time. It's just that I've had my share of girlfriends, and I've had doubts about every single one. Until of course, I met this one. She's literally everything I've ever searched for in a woman. She's mature (albeit still growing and discovering herself), funny, intelligent, nerdy, and very cute. very. cute. For her, I'm one of the only people, even among her oldest friends, that understands her and knows what she's thinking even without her having to say it sometimes. She sees a future with me, and despite being very shy, not afraid to admit that she loves me and is willing to see this through together.

We have our share of obstacles. We're both asian, and i guess love and romance isn't really something either of our parents get. Her parents especially. She's not aloud to have guy friends, let alone date. There's distance as well. We're both from the Dallas/Ft. Worth area, but i have to go back to school in Georgia in a week, but i guess i can't do a very good job of taking care of her unless i finish my education and get a career going. Of course there will be more obstacles. However, despite all of this and more going against us, we've both found in each other something that we both know will be hard to find again, and appreciate what we have as something special. We talk things out as a team and we know that we'll just have to learn and figure things out as we go along.

We know it's a long shot, but we've made up our minds that it's worth the risk, and for the most part our main concerns are our ability to do our part in the relationship. We want to do a good job taking care of each other and we don't want to slack, but that's also something we've agreed to work through and compromise just like any other obstacles we may face. As happy as we are to have found each other, we know this will be work. Encouragement and advice would be really appreciated even if it's from total strangers. We know we are young, so it's natural for people (especially on her side) to be skeptical. They care about us and don't want us to make a mistake. We want to show them that we're not. :)

We broke up about 1.5 years ago because I'm an alcoholic. I quit drinking after she broke up with me, we got back together several months later. Right off the bat, the sex was different than from before the breakup. First of all, she never initiates, unless I make it clear I need it. Second of all, it's BORING! Missionary, flip her over, finish. 

I try to make it exciting. I go down on her (she hasn't blown me since we got back together 1.5 years ago) try to make her feel good, but I can tell she's not into it. She was never the horniest girl, but we used to have sex/fool around at least a couple times a week. Now I'm lucky if it's once a month. I've told her a couple times how I feel like more of a friend/family member than a boyfriend and that I wish things could be more intimate between us. She's great at cuddling and smooching me, but that makes me mad, because I feel like she gets satisfaction while I'm sitting there stewing in my own juices!

To make matters worse, we live together and have so much shit intertwined that even thinking about breaking about gives me a headache. I do want to make it work though, but I fear the sex life will only get worse in the future.  I understand that she's busy, and I'm less busy. She works full time and goes to school. But I know there are plenty of busy people out there that make there love life work.

How do I make it clear how important sex is to me without threatening to break up? I've tried telling her numerous times, after which we'll have sex (for those that don't know, guilt sex is terrible). 

I feel like if this matter was solved, nearly everything would be great. We love each other, we do anything for each other, make each other laugh, etc. But lately I've been really pissed off ALL the time around her, because my mind keeps going back to the fact that I haven't received any sexual advance from her in MONTHS!

What should I do?

Evolution 'fails on all counts'

To The Editor:

Nick Cormier got the definition down right; the problem is evolution doesn't seem to qualify.

In ""Correcting misinformation"" (Forum, Dec. 21) Mr. Cormier defines a scientific theory as ""a collection of observable phenomena described using quantifiable properties and expressed using laws."" Going from inert matter to humans is not observable, even though famous atheist Richard Dawkins says ""Evolution has been observed. It's just that it hasn't been observed while it's happening.""

Saying ""chance mutations"" did it is not using quantifiable properties or using any of the accepted laws of science as ""chance"" is not a creative force, and mutations are corruptions or mistakes, which degrade the genome. Evolution fails as a scientific theory on all counts.

None of this will slow down the acceptance of evolution as theory, or fact for that matter, as most academics agree with Richard Lewontin who said: ""We take the side of science (evolution) in spite of the patent absurdity of some of its constructs, in spite of its failure to fulfill many of its extravagant promises of health and life, in spite of the tolerance of the scientific community for unsubstantiated just-so stories, because we have a prior commitment, a commitment to materialism. It is not that the methods and institutions of science somehow compel us to accept a material explanation of the phenomenal world, but, on the contrary, that we are forced by our a priori adherence to material causes to create an apparatus of investigation and a set of concepts that produce material explanations, no matter how counter-intuitive, no matter how mystifying to the uninitiated. Moreover, that materialism is an absolute, for we cannot allow a Divine Foot in the door."" Evolution versus Divine Creation, the 'conversation' will no doubt continue!

Like parents should, they disciplined me *themselves* when I did something wrong.  This is an idea I can get behind and I agree that the idea of Santa should not be presented in that way.

The rest of the idea of Santa, however, seems harmless to me.  I'm an atheist, and even I think a childhood of believing in something that doesn't exist isn't particularly harmful.  Children create imaginary friends all the time, and seems to be a natural part of their development.  Is it a real problem to have an imaginary friend that brings presents?

Finally, there seems to be contention that children are affected psychologically when they find out that Santa does not exist.  Myself, I figured it out when there were some obvious clues, such as the fact that Santa would use the same wrapping paper as my parents.  When I thought about many of the clues, I gradually lost my belief in Santa throughout ages 8 to 9 without any crying or yelling or what-have-you. 

So what are your actual thoughts on all of this?  Anyone care to share some stories about what happened when you or your children realized that there was no Santa?",-1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I'll try to explain my thought process as impartially as possible and I hope people will trust that I'm asking this question in earnest and not provocatively. *Obviously because of the nature of the question and my evidence, very fundamentalist readers and I are going to be at an impasse and probably should not bother with a response, at least for the purpose of addressing me specifically*
-------------------------------------------------------------------

We are told that God has endowed man with free will, and the ability to choose whether we believe in him or not.

It is this free will that is pointed to as the reason why God is not to be regarded as cruel or unfair when we see plainly that in some cases he has created individuals who, for example, reject a belief in God. They willfully made their choice, and so they are accountable to only themselves for the consequences, right? It's nice and tidy.

My problem, however, is that I don't believe free will exists, which makes this a much more sticky question.

 A lot of my friends look at me funny when I say ""I don't believe in free will"", and they use justifications like how they picked out their wardrobe this morning and could have worn anything they wanted, or that they definitely chose what to have for breakfast as evidence that they have absolute free will to decide for themselves what they want or believe. The thought that we are not the captain of our own vessel is undoubtedly an unnerving one, and so I don't begrudge them for not being very warm to the idea. 

I don't believe in a ""Destiny"" in the romantic sense of the word, but I do believe that every moment is a incremental step, proceeding forward as a result of the previous moment, which has been happening since the beginning of the universe; A grand cosmic chain reaction, if you will. Physics and Chemistry are largely about causality; one thing bumps another and sends it shooting off this way, or X+Y yields Z. If you had a supernatural understanding of physics and could know all the possible variables--basically, if you had God's omniscience, It seems like you could know and predict how the entire universe would unfold in the same way that a lowly High Schooler in physics class can accurately predict the parabolic arc that a football will travel when kicked. I think this viewpoint is referred to as a ""deterministic universe"".

If we can explain cosmic phenomenon like how the stars work with chemistry, why not the human brain? We are, after all, made of stardust. The brain is a complicated organ which we are not anywhere close to having a comprehensive understanding of, but I think a reasonable and realistic person will have to admit that the wonder of human cognition, incredible as it is, ultimately is the sum result of the efforts of billions of smaller systems within the brain. The fundamental building blocks of the brain are something that we DO have some understanding of and can plainly see their mechanics. The hydrogen atoms incorporated into a neuron seem to be no different than the hydrogen found abundantly in the oceans.

This is a roundabout way of saying that the stuff of brains seems to have no special characteristic which sets it apart from all other observable matter. Knowing this, how can we say that human brains can avoid causality or the basic rules of physics and chemistry any more than a glass of water can choose to ignore fluid dynamics?

So then where do we get free will from? This is the point where, personally, I come to the conclusion that free will must not exist. The *illusion* of free will and our inner monologue is, however, absolutely convincing, and I think the question of why we have an inner monologue at all is a fascinating biological mystery. I am curious how religious people who maintain belief in free will might answer the question of where free will comes from, specifically in regards to the mechanics of the brain. Is there a metaphysical soul inside our brains, piloting the machine, and that is the impetus that supposedly frees us from the confines of causality?

Anyhow, continuing, the point of my musings on the brain comes to a crux here. 

Let's run an imaginary experiment. We sit a subject down and ask them to choose: tea or coffee? Maybe they pick the one that is sweeter, or the one they think is healthiest, or the one they *don't* want just to stick it to the experimenter and exercise their ""free will"", or maybe they have no clue why and pick one randomly. If we could rewind time and ask the same question again, would we get the same answer, every single time? Why wouldn't we get the same answer, if all the atoms and sub atomic particles and *everything* were put back exactly the same and the ""go"" button on the Rube Goldberg machine were pressed. There is no free will being exercised in this model at all, as far as I can tell.

So now that I've disproved free will (haha, to myself at least), where does this leave us with God?

It leaves us with a world where people can break every rule God has made for conducting a life on earth and they will be doing exactly what God had set them up to do from the beginning of the universe. What kind of God would knowingly create something a certain way and then punish it for its nature?

The inescapable conclusion is that, without free will, God is either unimaginably cruel, or absolutely obsessed with formality and has by human standards a very perverse sense of accountability-- the kind of logic that says a match can be guilty of arson.

So the essence of my question is, how do Christians negotiate this issue? I'm going to assume most do believe in free will, at which point I ask how you justify that belief rationally. If you're a Christian and you do not believe in free will, how do you negotiate the troubling position this puts God in as being directly and knowingly responsible for all of man's depravity?

If you're anybody at all and have relevant, credible, information about the scientific topics that I've invoked, I would be delighted to be corrected or learn more about something.

I went from non-religious to christian about a year ago, and even before that, I would say ""Merry Christmas"" back to anyone who'd say ""Merry Christmas"", likewise, I'd have said ""Happy Hanukkah"" back to anyone who'd have said ""Happy Hanukkah"". Although this never happened, you know what I mean. Lie: It happened at Diwali, see below.


To me, the ""Happy holiday"" thing is some wish-wash, PC way to erase differences. Differences are awesome! I recently was invited to my indian friend's house for Diwali, and I had a blast learning about it! I even posted on Reddit about this: [Sita sings the blues](http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/e2jb8/sita_sings_the_blues/). I loved that her and her friends said happy Diwali to me (Although I'm *obviously* not indian!), and I happily wished them happy Diwali back. What's the big problem?

Tom and I just became very good friends as I was breaking up with my ex this fall. I shared a lot of personal things with him, and we spent a lot of time together just hanging out and talking. I wasn't really attracted to him, even though i was rebounding. Then, maybe two weeks ago, he started being randomly flirtatious while we were out with friends. He took me aside and told me how beautiful he thought I was, and how he talked about me with his guy friends and how generally great he thought I was. I sort of shrugged it off. After that point, though, I began thinking that maybe he liked me-- we get along so great-- and maybe i liked him back. So last night I went out and he happens to live not so far from me so we met up. I was really drunk, and I asked him what he thought about us dating. He looked at me straight in the eye and said that he wasn't attracted to me. I basically blankly stared and got up and left. It was so, so, so embarrassing and I just feel like I've been punched in the face. Why would a guy tell me I was ""beautiful"" totally unsolicited and then tell me he was not interested in me?
I'm not a bad-looking person. I get compliments often and don't have trouble attracting men. I'm petite but have big boobs and have been told I look like mila kunis. (i'm ukranian like her)
He is tall, lanky and very trendy. He's into philosophy, shopping and music. He's better dressed than I am.  He has had maybe two serious girlfriends.
Is he just a manipulative jerk? Or gay? Or am I just hopelessly misreading signals?
Here's the other thing. My friend told me a story that he did a very similar thing to another girl he was friends with-- he spent a lot of time with her after a breakup and then told her he wasn't attracted to her.

He also told me how passionate he thought i was about my goals. I responded by smiling and saying thank you-- it was so unexpected and i didn't know how to react.

So now I have 25 bucks in my steam wallet I don't want and I still can't buy my son his Christmas presents. Christmas is just about over here (Australia) so he has to miss out for today. Still he has plenty of games to keep him busy for now.

**tl;dr**
Steam declined three payment methods for games including steam wallet funds when trying to gift for Christmas leading to no sale fail.

234491,"Hey /r/Libertarian,

I've been a mild Libertarian for a while now, and I've described my position to others like this:

* *Democrats*: Into controlling your money, less interested in controlling your personal life.
* *Republicans*: Into controlling your personal life, less interested in controlling your money.
* *Better*: Take the Democrat's stance on personal life, and the Republican's stance on money, and you're doing much better than before.

Note: These are broad stroke type descriptions, and they usually suffice for a discussion like this.


For what it's worth, according to [politicalcompass](http://www.politicalcompass.org), I'm:

Economic Left/Right: -1.12

Social Libertarian/Authoritarian: -5.59 


I used to be FAR more economically ""hands off"" than I am now.  And I wanted to yak with you folks about it.


Here's are the arguments I've been mulling over for quite some time now, laid out in ""assumptions and conclusions"" format:

* *Assumption 1-A*: Fiscally speaking, Democrats tend to be less Libertarian than conservatives.  (Taxes, regulation, social-program-spending, ...) 
* *Assumption 1-B*: The 16 years we had under Clinton and Bush-2 fit relatively well with Assumption 1.
* *Assumption 1-C*: Our economic situation was significantly better under Clinton than under Bush-2 (Trying to take as sophisticated view on this as I can:  Give time for them to get going, and make them responsible for the starting period of the next president.  Wars are tricky here.)
* *Conclusion 1*: Perhaps a more Libertarian fiscal policy doesn't necessarily result in a better economy.

.


* *Assumption 2-A*: For quite some time now (Since Carter I think) the ""income gap"" tends to be larger under Republican presidents/congresses than when Democrats are in charge.
* *Assumption 2-B*: During that same time period, Republicans have fit better fiscally with a Libertarian's views than Democrats.
* *Assumption 2-C*: Large ""income gaps"" are at the very least, not extremely desirable, and may be harmful if they are too big.  (Think access to justice, policy influence, ability to buy healthier food [fresh vegetables vs. ramen], ...)
* *Conclusion 2*: Perhaps a more Libertarian fiscal policy doesn't necessarily result in a better quality of life for the general populace.

.


* *Assumption 3-A*: Republicans match the fiscal components of Libertarian ideals better than they match the social components of Libertarian ideals.
* *Assumption 3-B*: Democrats match the social components of Libertarian ideals better than they match the fiscal components of Libertarian ideals.
* *Assumption 3-C*: Most Libertarians, when voting for one of the big two American political parties, end up voting Republican.
* *Conclusion 3*: Most Libertarians care more about fiscal issues then social issues.


.


Obviously, I'm taking a very high view here; as there are clearly specific places where the general trends I've tried to lay out above do not fit the model.  But I think, as a whole, the basic ideas are relatively accurate.

Also, I'm ignoring all sorts of other social goals a society generally desires. (Safety from foreign entities, mild political stability, fairness, equality, ...)


*Note:* I tried to lay this out in an organized fashion to facilitate intelligent discussion.  If you disagree with something, let me know which part.  Is it my assumption that's the issue, or does my conclusion not follow from my assumptions.



EDIT: Formatting (Good god, do I apparently love bullet points.  I've got to figure out a good way to put in a line break.)

EDIT 2: Most of the comments I'm seeing are vaguely in these two catagories:

* *Don't try to compare right vs. left, and don't fit Libertarians into some combination of those two camps.*

I find that tremendously difficult.  It's the only system we've got to examine right now, (at least at a large scale) and the only major changes I can think of, with which to base conclusions on, are policy shifts or (by proxy) major vote swings.

* *The Republicans aren't what you think they are. They're just as bad as the Democrats.*

I don't disagree.  However, I think the rhetoric and, well, bitching is so much stronger against Democrats than it is against Republicans.  There is/was nowhere near the level of contempt for Bush/Cheney in /r/Libertarian as there is for Obama/Pelosi.  And most Libertarians I've met usually vote Republican. (If they aren't ""wasting their vote"" on the Libertarian candidate.  I know it's not wasted, but you definitely know what I'm getting at.)  I mean, there's a reason Ron Paul is a Republican, not a Democrat.  ",1,-1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I'm a little confused on a situation and would like some insight if anyone has any, so here's the background.  I'll try and keep this as short as possible. 

I was dating this guy for a couple of months, and then we ended things because our life paths were sort of incompatible.  So that was in early November, and I figured we would pretty much never talk again.  Since then, we've emailed and texted a bit, sometimes I initiate and sometimes he does.  I assumed that this was because even though we were no longer seeing each other, neither of us is the type of person who runs out and finds someone else immediately, so the attention is sort of nice and to be honest, on my end, ending things was not exactly what I wanted.  However, I'm okay with it, even though I think it's stupid.  

So I figured you know, whenever someone started seeing someone else (I assumed it would be him and I assumed I would feel bad when this happened, but I would deal with it then) we would stop talking.  Then he started calling me.  He doesn't call a lot (maybe once a week) and we talked once for a while, but I was nervous and after that, I thought, ""this is it, we're never talking again,"" and then he called the next week and the week after that.  I have since avoided being on the phone with him for any excessive length of time.  

I don't know what's happening.  Are we being friends?  I don't really need more friends.  But what if it's something more?  I know I should ask, but we're supposed to hang out (what?!) in a couple of weeks and part of me wants to see how it plays out and part of me is so nervous because even just being on the phone made me nervous.  I just don't know how to act.  I'm so not all breezy and cool in these situations.  Do you guys have any ideas? What is he thinking?  Could my dreams come true and he'll confess that he made a mistake?  

I'd just like to say that though I sound like a basket case to you guys, I don't think I come off that way to him.

For the past few weeks I've read story after story of teens and young adults admitting their atheism to their parents and the parents reacting with horror, ridicule and scorn.  I just want to send some fatherly love out to my fellow redditors who may not be feeling any at the moment.  

I am an atheist and believe it is up to my boys to decide what it is they believe.  If they become Baptist preachers, I'll love them just as much as if they become the Richard Dawkins of the next generation.  Any parent that would disown or shun their child over religious beliefs isn't much of a christian in my book.  

My 18 year old is a self-described deist who thinks there may be some sort of prime mover, but doesn't believe in rewards or punishment in the afterlife.  My 14 year old doesn't talk about religion, but has gone to church with his mom and would probably say he believed in god if someone asked him.  I leave it up to him to talk to me about it if he wants to.  

I recently admitted my atheism at work to a couple of evangelical co-workers and one of them thanked me for making him think (he was asking what my morals were based on and after explaining, I asked him if I could prove that god didn't exist, would he go out and start raping and killing others).   I'm hoping it doesn't affect my career (I live in the South where atheism is about the same level as a bearded lady).

240410,"I saw a lot of great threads these last few days. I saw people just giving away games for no real reason. I, of course, tried to get some, because who honestly doesn't like free stuff? 

A few hours ago, I found an old unused access key for Guild Wars. I was going to try to sell it, maybe get some cash to get some more games before the sale ends. But then I remembered all the other people who were gifting games to random people. 

Now, I don't celebrate Christmas (or any holiday, for that matter) so today isn't different from any other day. I don't worry about getting gifts or giving them. I'm not selfish, though. I just don't really have anyone to do these things with. I was raised to believe that anyone who wasn't from the same religion was evil and would ""cause me to stray from the path."" For the last 15 years, I've spent my time ignoring people and being alone, especially during holidays. 

Why am I rambling? I don't know. Anyway, for some reason I decided to give the code I found to someone. So I posted it here, and got a few replies almost immediately. As I gave it to the person who responded first, I looked at the other people who had replied, hoping they would be lucky enough to get something. I felt bad, perhaps because I'm not used to causing disappointment for anyone other than my parents. It hurt me to have to choose who would get it. But fair is fair, and the person who asked first got it. 

I was about to close the page and go back to browsing when an idea struck. I had a bit of money I was saving for some games that may pop up as daily deals. After the last few days of sales, I realized that I didn't really need to buy a game just because it's on sale. I have a lot of games already. I should use a bit of it to give someone else a game. So I did. I looked through the names of the others who had replied, added them to a list, and edited my post to let them know that I would give away another game. They simply had to reply with a game choice within a certain time frame and I would choose one to get the game. Seeing as I'm unemployed, I put the limit at $5. 

I waited a while before I got 3 responses: two from people who missed their chance on the access code, and another from a random person who saw the post afterwards. I hate to admit it, but I had almost been hoping that nobody would reply. Why? I didn't want to have to choose between them. What's wrong with me? Why couldn't I do this, when so many others can? I waited to see if any others would respond. If there were more, I could just number them and use a random number generator to pick for me. That would make it so much easier, I told myself. 

I waited for what seemed like hours (it was maybe 10 minutes) before I finally decided I would have to choose. I looked at the three people I had to choose from. Three. Not ten, not 50. THREE. 

Then I looked at my bank account again.

""well, one of them is asking for a game that costs less than a dollar. and it's only $5 for each of the others. I can do this.""

And I did. I gave each of them a game of their choice, and 2 to the person asking for the cheapest game. Why? I don't know. Maybe I felt bad for giving something so cheap. Maybe I thought they deserved more for putting up with my indecisiveness. 

Maybe, deep down, I'm just nice. 

Crazy, I know, but it was just a thought. I felt relieved to be done with it, and I felt pretty good. I still couldn't imagine how all these other people could do this so much. Every few minutes there was another kind-hearted person giving stuff away. I went back to reloading the new submissions page like the addict I am.

Then, an orange envelope.

Messages from the people who received their games, thanking me. A smile stuck itself on my face. There was the good feeling others must feel, this warmth. With a small gesture of kindness, I had made someone else happy. After the depressing few days I've had, suddenly I feel like I did something that mattered. I felt good. 

A while later, I received another message from the person who received two games. It said:

""I would like to take a moment to properly thank you for your kindness. I extend my sincere gratitude to you, for this gift has put me past the tipping point in terms of how I lead my life. Lately a number of things have changed, with this being the most recent. This year has been an interesting one, albeit long and stressful. I became stressed, cynical, and frustrated largely with my environment, and didn't deal with the right things. These past few months I begrudgingly began to change, and these past few months have been the most beneficial and rewarding out of the entire year. I see my self as a better person now, and your kindness has influenced my view of the world and community. I hope you and your close ones have a very happy holidays, and I wish you all a very happy and safe new year. Thank you very much =]""

2 games. Two cheap little games that I gave to them on a whim. That's all I did. I had no idea how to reply. I just said something short (and dumb) and went back to what I was doing. But, obviously, it stayed in my mind. And that's why I'm here. I just wrote this thing for I don't know how long, i'm a terrible writer, and I bet nobody will see it anyway. But I don't care. I'm proud of what I did. I may be broke now, but I made other people happy. And that's that.

240823,"It's upsetting me how difficult it is to get a nice permanent stubble look!
I tough I was being clever when I asked my parents to get me a ""trimmer"" for Christmas, instead what I got was plastic garbage, it came in this kit called ""Conair trimming kit"" I was exited, took me 3 hours to re-read the instructions until they made sense, and wasn't worth it, it's not working, the main piece in the trimmer kit was a clipper, I'm def not impressed by it, but I did some research online and from the looks of it, most people use professional grade clippers, I went on amazon and quickly did a search for ""trimmer"" and placed ""search by ratings"" 
this is what it gave me: http://www.amazon.com/Wahl-8655-Peanut-Shaped-Clipper/dp/B000M1IX92/ref=sr_1_5?s=hpc&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1293355712&amp;sr=1-5
it looks legit but all the ratings are positive, so I went to check other ratings of other Wahl products and it was the same thing and one was over the top like ""I'm a barber and I recommend this and my clients do too"" 
so I'm guessing they might be cheating the system... if anyone is knowledgeable in clippers please let me know what you think.

The biggest obstacle I see is cutting weight.  I live in Korea,(my gym is Korean Top Team, where the Korean Zombie trains at!) and I find myself just buying whatever is cheap and easy to get during my lunch time. ""Healthy"" food is quite expensive here in Korea, contrary to what many people may think about Asian food.  And I am 6 feet tall, so I figure I should cut down 40 lbs, to 180.  Right now I'm at 220 and 22% body fat.  Worst of all I love food.

P.S.  I know I'm still a beginner, but losing weight(not water, fat) takes a lot of time and I gotta think ahead.  And I lift weights regularly, but only do cardio while actually mma training because of permanent knee and ankle injuries.

241614,"I asked [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/eqnoo/how_should_i_cook_a_duckling/) how I should cook a duck and looked at a few other place online. I'm afraid I forgot to take any pictures (I was running about an hour late and hadn't had any breakfast by the time it was all done!), but trust me - it looked as good as it tasted, and it tasted pretty damn good! Choice comment from a guest: ""I wasn't sure I liked duck, but now I definitely do!""

**This is bascially what I did:**  
I trimmed the duck of excess fat inside, and the skin from the tail, then rinsed it under running water. I pierced the skin several times all over with a sharp knife, the put it on a rack upside down, before puring a small amount of boiling water over it into the pan (this apparently loosens the fat, I'm not sure I would bother doing this step again though). I then stuck it in a pre-heated oven at about 220C for half an hour. After that half hour I took it out, drained the fat from the pan so I could do the roast potatoes in it, and put it back in the right way up, realised I had forgotten to season it and sprinkled it with a little salt, before turning the heat down to about 180C and left it for about another hour. I then took it out to make room to do the side dishes (I need a bigger, and ideally fan assisted, oven!). Once they were done I put the duck back in and turned the temerature back up to finish crisping up the skin. 

While that was cooking for the first half hour I chopped the gibblets and the trimmed fat and skin, and stuck them and the blood from the gibblets bag in a pan on the stove, while I boiled a kettle. I had intended to brown the gibblets but there was too much liquid, so I didn't bother and just added some boiling water, a couple of bay leaves and cloves, and a lid and left it to simmer for a good long time. Later, while peeling the potatoes I added the skins too. After about an hour and a half I drained the liquid from the bits, chucked them away and oput the liquid back on the stove. I added a generous teaspoon full of honey and a good spalsh of red wine, put the lid back on and left it to simmer. After a while I thought ""I had better thicken this gravy now"", and took a look at it, only to realise the water had all cooked away and I had made duck, honey and wine flavoured toffee sauce! I thinned it down a little and it made the most amazing sweet-savoury sauce for the duck! Pure accident massively improved the meal!

I served it with roast potatoes cooked in the duck fat, with a little salt, pepper and paprika, some stuffing made frm a cheap packet of sage and onion stuffing mix made up with orange juice instead of water, and some pork sausage meat that had cranberries and apple in it which I had got cheap, pressed into a pan and topped with pepper and breadcrumbs. I then realised I had forgotten to cook the carrots and hurridly did some peas! I completely forgot to do devils on horseback (sausages wrapped in bacon) and will have them today instead. 

All in all it was good. Very good. And I will be cooking duck again in the future! Thanks to everyone who gave me advice.

241720,"Hi r/Buddhism. This is something I was just thinking about while taking a shower (when all the best thinking happens, duh). It's not super profound or anything, but I felt the urge to type it out here.

I see a whole lot of conversation in this subreddit about whether or not Buddhism is a religion. Is it? Is it not? Is it a way of life? Is it a philosophy with a meditative component? There's nothing wrong with this conversation. I don't think it's going to stop any time soon, and I'm not trying to squash it or anything.

However, I've been taught, and tend to believe, that part of Right View is no fixed view. The minute we label something, especially something like The Great Way, we make a mistake. Don't get me wrong, in our relative reality, it's a constantly necessary mistake of convenience to refer to transitory things in there present state. But in that light, it might be especially helpful in this case to relax our views of what Buddhism is or is not and just practice.

Buddhism is whatever it needs to be for any given practitioner.  And just like the chair you're sitting on can only be called a chair because it's comprised entirely of non-chair elements, Buddhism can only be called Buddhism because it is inherently empty of any fixed identity. To way oversimplify something as huge as a ""major world religion*"" it is both Buddhism, not Buddhism, both, and neither.  Apply the same formula to the (already slippery) words ""religion"" and ""philosophy"".

So that's my muddled take on it this morning. I hope you all had a good December 25th, whatever that day means to you!  Deep bows to all of you.

241967,"So:  Six months ago I was dumped by my girl of 5 years (started dating at 19, lived together past 3).  I'm still a mess about it, and I want some closure.  I spent a significant amount of that time fixing her.  She had serious emotional problems and my constant support transformed her from a really broken kid into a effective human being.  I even got her into grad school through recommendations and introductions (on top of emotional support).

I never implied that my support was a charity (in fact, when she felt unworthy of my ""generosity"", I justified it by saying when the tables were turned, she'd support me, and she agreed).

Jump to last year.  She finally has less stress / less crazy than me.  I'm working like crazy and she's finished with grad school apps and has a year to enjoy herself.  Which she does.  Without me.  I don't have the energy to confront her because I'm completely swamped.  Housework?  I do that.  What does she do?  Lots of empty promises.  Excuse:  ""I'm going to grad school, this is my last chance to have fun.""

At the end of the year she dumps me.  And I'm sick of her because she's been so absent.  But really, I just want her to shape up, not leave.

I just feel that she owes me.  She owes me for what I've put in.  She owes me for where she is in life.  And she tells me that I should have left her instead of giving.  Well I certainly would have if I had realized that it was a one way street.

I have a hard time giving up on this girl who I've putten so much into.  But I know I'm wasting my time if I want to get back with her and I feel like I'm wasting my time with regards to simply getting her to admit to herself that she's wrong.  But without that, I end up feeling so much more used / abandoned / worthless.

Am I deluding myself into thinking that some closure will make anything any better?  Or should I cut my losses, deal with the depression and try to move on without it.

243249,"This happened when I was 11 years old (I'm 20 now), after the death of a very close family friend who drowned after a scuba equipment malfunction.

I had a very hard time dealing with it, mostly because I had an extremely difficult trying to justify what reason any God could have for doing this to our friend. I had contemplated motives of God in the past regarding situations such as poverty in certain areas of the world, but **this specific situation affected me in a most profound way.** The answers I was getting from my parents (both Hindu) and many family friends (mostly Christian/Catholic) only fueled my frustration, as they provided no logical reasoning I could deem satisfactory.

**Then it hit me.** When I took God out of the equation and just broke down the series of events that lead to our friends death, I was able to perceive the situation for what it actually was instead of having so many unanswered questions.

I can safely say this method of **logical reduction** and reasoning is what eased the pain in not just dealing with the death of our family friend, but also in the deaths of others close to me including my older sister when I was 19.

Getting back to me telling my Hindu parents that I'm an Atheist (sorry for wandering off a bit, but I think it is relevant to this)... They had noticed I was having a very hard time dealing with the situation and finding answers as to why it happened, but when I finally took the godless route of logical reduction, they had noticed I was able to deal with the situation much easier than I had before.

So after having a little spiritual smalltalk talk with them about how I had dealt with it, **I just came out and said ""I cannot believe there is a God who would have any good reason to do this to Pete, and if there is I refuse to worship such a being. ""I don't believe in God.""**

Immediately my Dad smiled and said **""son, you may refuse to worship a God or refuse to believe in a God, and in response to that your mother and I refuse to impose our beliefs on you. You must understand that your status as our son has and always will have priority over our religious beliefs no matter what.""**

I was just in awe. I couldn't believe my parents, who are **very** devout Hindus were so open with my decision. After that, they had no problem with me not going to the temple to pray with them (sometimes I went anyways out of respect) and no problem with my not participating in any of their religious activities. They were very open to our religious friends and family about me being an Atheist, and defended my choice vehemently.

I cannot generalize and say all Hindus are this tolerant, but from my personal experience with my parents and literally every other Hindu (and Buddhist) I've met, I have had **zero** issues with them in terms of respecting each others beliefs. No backhanded comments, no condescension-- nothing but genuine mutual respect.

243957,"I just got myself a PS3 for Christmas and was looking at some information about PSN+. I do like some of the perks like free avatars and free themes, but would that itself be worth it. So I want to know anyone out there who has the service if it is something they recommend or if it's one of those ""Get it only if you like...""situations. I did some pros and cons and hopefully you guys can add some. Though 3.33 a month for it (current deal of $50 for 15 months) isn't too bad, those $50 can also mean getting a few games on sale.

Pros
- Free Avatars
- Free Themes
- Free Games
- A chance to try some awesome games that I would have otherwise never played
- Any discounted items purchased are yours to keep
- Anything free that was not a game is yours to keep
- If you didn't have a subscription for some time, but resubscribe at a later date all previous free downloaded games are yours once more

Cons
- Free games are not chosen by you
- Free games are no longer playable if you unsubscribe

So as can be seen, the biggest plus to me seems to be those free games monthly. I mean the one game currently is a whole season of Sam &amp; Max, not too bad, but if I ever unsubscribe then I no longer have access to it. On the other hand I was reading a bit about gamesharing. So technically I could get games I actually would want at a discount. 

Is there anything I am missing? I seem to be leaning more into it not being such a bad deal. I understand playing online is already free. The games you download for free, if you delete them, I assume it is still ok for you to download them again for free as long as you remain a subscriber.

Reddit. Today I was attending Christmas celebrations with the extended family, it was a most joyous occasion with Wii balance board games, bountiful food, delicious bacon and unlimited fermented beverages. The conversation was enlightening and intelligent.

Reddit. I tell you this because you have to understand the enormity of what happened next to comprehend the ramifications. Every year we have a raffle where people will throw a die and; if presented with the correct amount of little black spots on the side facing upwards, one will be provided one(1) present to place in front of them. The amount of presents one may amass is without a defined limit.

Reddit. They changed the rules. I'm not sure why one is allowed to change the rules of a tradition but nevertheless it was done, this was my first taste on the bad side of democracy. The new rules were as follows: The presents were to be spread evenly this year, though we were 3 presents short. Each person would throw a die and pass one of their presents counter clockwise to the person whose distance-in-people from you was equal to the amount of little black spots on the side facing upwards.

Reddit. I had 4 presents when the clock chimed it's signal that the games was now over. 4 presents.

Reddit. They changed the rules. There was an additional round. This time the die would pass around to all the people without presents, allowing them a die throw. Upon hitting one of two magic amounts of little black spots they would be allowed to demand a tribute of one (1) present from any person at the table in possession of a gift. People with gifts were now allowed a die throw.

Reddit. I had 4 presents. 4 presents. By the end of the second round I had 0 presents. 0 presents.

Reddit. I implore you to understand the significance of this horrendous acts of Godlessness. If these liberals will heartlessly steal the presents of a hard working family member what will they then stop at? Our money? Our clothes? The teeth in our mouth? I dare not even consider the extend of their greed. Immediate action is required to prevent this so-far-isolated case to explode into a global epidemic of Christmas-stealing Grinches.

Reddit. Next election, vote for me as dictator, I promise there will be absolutely no stolen presents or teeth. I am your last hope.

Thank you for your attention.

I've been to Alabama with her to meet her adopted parents, old childhood friends and the like and everywhere we went, everyone just couldn't stop talking about their pets. In Texas, when we go out to dinner with her biological family, without fail, pets are almost the dominating topic (with the family business coming in a relatively distant second).

Every time the subject comes up, everyone has to talk about 'funny' things their pet(s) do or have done, pictures have to be shared, etc. Now, this wouldn't bother me so much if this only occurred every now and then or if it was only for a small amount of time. Unfortunately, pets come up EVERY time, and it dominates most of what is typically at least a 2 hour dinner.

I refused to take a mini-family one with my ""parents"" because they were never parents to me, but I still wanted to take one with the rest of my family for my great-grandparents. We took the pictures, left, and I didn't think about them again.

Christmas morning I woke up at my Gram's (different from the one the pictures were originally for) and went to the tree to put down her present to find a picture of me with my parents staring back at me. They paid the photographer alot of money to photoshop me from the huge family picture into the one with them. I uncontrollably freaked out (not at anyone, just kinda started freaking out). My gram told me that it was a gift to her from my parents and that my other grandma did it for them.

Well, I went over to her house and confronted her about it. She took my parents side of it and said she didn't mean to hurt me by it, but I don't see how it wouldn't have hurt me. She was there for the pictures and saw me argue with my parents and the photographer to not be in the picture. They never asked me if I was okay with it. Why would I want to be associated with the people who abused me?

What do you guys think?

Edit: Because you guys seem to want the full back-story. Here's a few examples of how my mom abused me and my dad just let it happen. 

Well, for starters, she used to physically abuse me. Like, smash my head against the wall, slap me, punch me, push me. I only remember some of it, my dad (who really wanted me to try to fix things with her) admitted that she used to do it all the time. Then, as I got older, she knew that I would tell someone about it, so she just started mentally/verbally abusing me. She would threaten me. ""If you don't ___ you won't be able to see or talk to (close friend that kept me sane for ___ (amount of time)."" ""You shut your mouth or else ___.""And at least once a day she says something extremely hurtful ""Go to your room and shut up, I don't want to even see you."" ""You're completely selfish, I can't believe you would want some of the money back that I stole from you!"" Except I added that last part in because she would never admit to taking my money. Even though I was constantly busy with school, housework, and martial arts she would call me lazy and tell me that all I'm good for is housework. That that was the reason why she had me. The one year, I wasn't doing too hot in school and she kept telling me over and over that I was going to fail and never tried getting me help (in 6th grade I didn't know how to get help). They never supported me in anything that I did. Ever. No matter what happened, it was always my fault. They would just scream at me constantly. They actually had me believing the way they were treating me was normal. That that's how life was, that that's what everyone went through. That you were supposed to use your kid for anything that you could. The times that she was actually human to me, actually made things worse. I would try to believe that she was getting better, that maybe we could have a functioning family, but in an instant she would go back to screaming at me for something or another. Everyone in my family agrees that she cares about her dogs more than anyone or anything. I'm not even joking. It's just absolutely insane. Nothing I did was ever good enough. Oh? You got your shodan (1st degree black belt)? Not good enough. A 95%GPA with all honors classes? Not good enough. Nothing was ever good enough. She would always find something to criticize. I started trying to spend more and more time elsewhere, with friends or with family. I was afraid/depressed to go home because I knew I would just get yelled at. Whenever I'd try to defend myself when she was yelling at me irrationally, she would just instantly cut me off from going anywhere or doing anything. I had absolutely no privacy. She would go through my things, including my computer. She would just walk in my room whenever she felt like it to scream at me. I had no sanctuary. I ended up being hospitalized because she caused so much stress to me that my body started to just act out. None of my doctors could find anything wrong with me except that I was under alot of stress. I'm sorry this reply was all over the place. It's very hard for me to pinpoint examples because it was every day life for me. It took me over three hours to try to explain it to my guidance counselor.

My boyfriend is from Singapore, but he studies here in Australia.  We have been going out for almost 6 months and are quite in love.  He hasn't come out to his family as they are Muslim, and believe that being gay is wrong.  Otherwise they are quite progressive and sound like lovely people.

On Friday I'm flying to Singapore where I will be staying with my bf's family and meeting them for the first time.  I'm a little terrified and want to give a good impression -_-'

I think they strongly suspect he is gay, but are in denial and will never ever talk about it, because as long as it remains unsaid it doesn't have to be confronted.  They can't be too uptight about though, as I am flying in and will be staying in his room, which seems pretty suss to me (although we are putting down a 2nd mattress.)

So I want to know what r/lgbt would recommend in terms of how to act in front of them.  I'm sure some of you have had to interact with your partners family when they don't know about your relationship.

If he ever changes his mind about telling them, I want them to know that I am good for him and for them to like me.  I don't want them to feel like I abused their hospitality or use me as a scapegoat for him being gay, rather than accepting him.

Is there any appropriate way to behave in this situation, or am I stuck with faking being only a friend, and hope for the best in the future.

**tl:dr**  I'm flying in to meet my bf's Muslim family.  They don't know he is gay and I don't know how to behave.

They also have NetFlix so I explain to them how they can use the Wii to watch movies through NetFlix instead of the snail mail way they've been doing. When I go to set it up, I go to the Shop Channel and it says it needs to update, so I accept, and it goes to the update screen, where the bar at the bottom doesn't move at all for about 30 seconds, then it says ""Error Code:32007"" Unable to perform the Wii system update. I try again, and again, and again... Same sh*t.

I'm no dummy, so I test the internet connection on the Wii and I can go on the ""Internet Channel"" just fine, browse google, youtube etc. with no issues whatsoever. I'm connected to the internet through a Linksys Wireless WRT54GS Router, that is on a DSL connection. I could try connecting through Ethernet but the geniuses who designed this box of crap decided to not include a 10/100 card but instead make you buy an accessory that converts USB to Ethernet (retarded), but I'd rather not spend the money on one just to see if this will work, and since the internet connection works anyways, I don't really see the point in going in that direction.

So I get on my laptop and Google the issue to find a few others who have experienced similar problems. This link is to the most relevant forum post I could find:

http://techforums.nintendo.com/message/12519

I also crawled several forums discussing opening ports on my router, changing the router channels, sacrificing my first-born (just kidding), among other ridiculous solutions that would make sense if the Wii WASN'T CONNECTING TO THE INTERNET, but it is, as I previously stated. I tried all this voodoo anyways and to no avail.

So my assumption is that there is something wrong with Nintendo's update service, or this Wii is broken. Seriously though, this is super frustrating and I really doubt when I call the Nintendo Tech Support guys they'll have anything to suggest that I haven't already tried.

Anyone else out there having similar issues? Any solutions you guys would suggest that won't cost me any money? Any and all suggestions are appreciated.

Hey y'all, I've run into a bit of a problem.  I installed Office 2010 on my desktop and laptop.  Recently I upgraded my desktop with a new MB, video card, processor, and memory.  Evidently when you do this, it trips a check on Windows and makes you re-activate everything (which pisses me off *substantially*).  Luckily re-activating Windows was just a matter of clicking a button, but I'm locked out of Office until I can get back home in a couple of weeks and find my product key.  

I was hoping there was a different way, though.  I've looked through the registry on my laptop but can't find it there (or did find it and didn't recognize it due to encryption).  I've been through one keyfinder (which didn't work) off the net but am hesitant to try others as they're not really recommended, rated, or from a site I recognize, so been avoiding them for the sake of not having my key stolen. 

Anyone know of a way or can recommend a legit key finder for Office 2010?  I found one called Magical Jelly Beans that looked like the real deal but it's $25 and I'm not *that* desperate.

249501,"I've been dumped by my girlfriend of two years today. And it's my fault. Only mine. I just hanged up the phone after she said that she doesn't miss me and she doesn't want to talk to me or meet me. I feel like a worthless shit and only now I understand how much I love her. I miss her already and something is eating me inside as I type these words. And if you bear with me and let me tell you how this happened, maybe you can help me do something about it.

I'm a twenty-five year old guy and my exgf is twenty-two years old. One day, while having a guys' night a friend of mine who has been to the US told me about the strip clubs and how you tip the girl while they dance for you (lap dance, I guess.) There's no strip clubs here so I never had the chance for that. I admit I'm a horny guy and the best thing I could experience something similar would be with the ladies who offer their services via instant-messaging protocols (Skype, MSN, Yahoo etc.) You may say, why not go directly to cam4.com and have some of it for free, but I just wanted to experience the tipping, or ""getting a hooker,"" I don't know. (btw I've never done such a thing.) 

So, this was on my mind -guess a few days after the talk- I was in the office and I knew a website where my exgf visits regularly. A place for questions and answers, much like AskReddit. So, I got a nick (headcrab, -I was playing HL2 at that time) and asked the users of the site whether they knew any ladies who offer their services via IM protocols. And I also demanded that I'd like to have an amateur one, and from my country, if possible. (The only reason for that it would be cheaper.) 

Then I got a few replies, and added the IM addresses to my throwaway MSN account. But I didn't have some money (or I guess I have some but I didn't want to do it right away) so I postponed it. Then, when I received my paycheck for the new month, I decided it was not the best thing to do, while you are in a relationship and gave up and decided to forget about the idea.

And indeed I forgot about it. I was getting used to that Q&amp;A website and started asking and replying game-related questions. My exgf knew very well that I'm an avid gamer and she also knew that I was playing HL2 at that time. We even discussed about the headcrabs in HL1. Anyway, after some time, she somehow found out that headcrab was actually me and that I asked a question about the ladies who offer adult services. (At that point I had already deleted the question from the said website but how could I knew that Google already cached it?!)

As expected, she went berserk, burned all the bridges and took no prisoners. She told me that we were over and would never see me again. I tried my best to explain that I was just curious and that I was not into other women but just wanted to try that feeling. Of course, she didn't believe me.

I was devastated and didn't know what to do. With some pathetic attempt [I turned to Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/em55g/i_did_a_grave_mistake_in_the_recent_past_and_now/) to do a stupid thing to save my relationship -Reddit didn't do it but suggested that I sent flowers and wait for a while. I had already thought about that and as far as I know her I knew that she would think I was bribing her into relationship. But nevertheless I went on with reddit's suggestion and [sent her some flowers](http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/enery/dear_redditors_help_me_save_my_relationship_please/) with a note saying ""I'm sorry. I love you.""  As expected, it didn't serve any good. 

Also, I waited for a week and tried to give her a call. First she didn't answer. After texting her, she did answer I tried to explain myself, I aplogized, tried to convinced her that I already understood tha tit was not a good move and didn't do it. Offered her to check my emails, phone conversations also bank account if she wanted to, but to no avail.

As you can understand, my last phone conversation with her didn't go well. (She declined my intivation for a last ""date."")

I don't know what to do at the moment. I feel like shit and all I can say to you guys that it isn't worth it. Don't try it. Just love your SO. Just fucking do it.

**Bottom line is:** I know I did a grave mistake, gf broke up with me and she's solid about that. Is there any chance that she could change her mind &amp; forgive me? What should I do during this period/eternity? Should I just wait or attempt other pathetic things? Or should I just forget about it? Also ladies of reddit, any suggestions on ideas?

This is also about only one girl I wanted feedback on, as I haven't been able to figure out how to make a move in this situation.

Anyway this HB7-8 (25 - 26 years old, I'm 27) works in my local pharmacy and I've always noticed her since I think she looks real cute. I haven't been in there too many times, but I've wondered how I might be able to chat her up. It's not easy in there, as there's always people waiting for their turn, and it's a number system where you don't choose who you are being served by.

The few times I've been in there, there hasn't been any flirting going on, or anything like that, but I did see her noticing me the first time. A long time passed where I haven't been in there, and I was just in there a week ago to buy some cough medicine. While I was waiting for my turn, our eyes met and she looks like she recognised me. I got the cashier next to her, and while I was talking to her, I caught the HB (with peripheral vision) checking me out 2-3 times.

I would have tried to make eye contact, but I was too engaged in my conversation; I was explaining how I got my cold from being out running on a particular cold day, and so forth.

Then today I was back there to buy some mouth wash, and also hoping to see her, and maybe see how it went. Not only was she there, but I also got her when my number was called.

I might have been imagining this, but during the whole thing I got the impression that she was a bit nervous. Especially when she saw that I was the one with her number. You know, the kind of nervous you'll maybe be yourself when talking to a hot girl and mustering the courage to ask her out.

This might not be so at all, but it was definitely a good state of mind for me thinking this about her.

I was keeping a confident frame, maintaining eye contact and mustered my best smirks throughout, but they weren't really reciprocated which was a major factor in me becoming confused about the situation.

The conversation was all business; I asked if they any of those pills you take to avoid hangovers and they didn't. I then asked if she knew where I might want to look to find those.

I punch in my PIN for payment, and ask if it's possible to get a bag from her for my mouth wash, and she says; ""Of course, I had actually already taken one out, but was in my own thoughts for a second there"".

I make a polite comment half jokingly, and says ""take care"" and am on my way again.

Normally when chatting up a girl I will be able to sense if she's interested in me even in the slightest, and my confidence will only grow the more smiles are exchanged and other IOI's. Then I would say something like ""Give me your number, then I can ask you out sometime"".

But I'm unsure of how to best proceed in closing this girl. As Mystery would say ""hired gun"". She's not overly nice though, like a hired gun would be for business, maybe she is just nervous. Still I don't know how to even take this to the next level in this circumstance.

With my cyberpolice-backtracking abilities I found her Facebook page, but I don't think that will be useful, except telling me that we have no friends in common.

250179,"So, I saw True Grit on Christmas day and thought it over for a couple of days...

First off I've got to say I absolute love all of the Coen Brothers works as well as Jeff Bridges. Though I still enjoyed the film and thought alone it was a great film, overall I was underwhelmed in comparison to the original. I find that I've come to have a very high expectation of the Coen Brothers and a lot of what makes their films great was missing in this film and I think it was because they tried to keep it true to the original. I did like several things that they did to update the film a bit and distinguish it some from the original.

I've got to say it's extremely hard to top John Wayne. There's no one else like him and I think Jeff Bridges did a great job at making his own Cogburn in the film. Though, I've got to say there were several moments in the film where I just couldn't understand what the hell he was saying. I absolutely love Jeff Bridges (saw Tron: Legacy last week, was awesome), but I just hope that the theater had audio issues and that was the reason for not understanding him.

As for Hailee Steinfeld, I thought her performance of Mattie was decent, but I didn't find it as raw of a performance as the original performed by Kim Darby. Throughout the remake, Mattie seemed pretty blunt and hardly showed any emotion. I know her character is supposed to be this brute woman that's all about settling the business of her father, but in the original you saw several incidents where emotion got the better of Mattie. I didn't really see any of this in the remake. This was probably mostly due to the age difference between the actresses of the original and the remake (but maybe that's how the Coen brothers wanted it). Hailee is more true to the age of the character while Kim Darby was actually 20 at the time of filming.

I've got to say I really did like how LaBoeuf's role in the remake of the film was made more significant. Of course it had to be when bringing a big star in like Matt Damon. In the original Glen Campbell's performance was mediocre, but he was never even an actor, so judging him as one isn't really fair and probably why his role was smaller.

I think the biggest issue I had with the film was the ending. I understand the Coen brothers wanted to make a significant difference with it because they kept true to much of the script throughout the film, but the ending was just so far fetched. I couldn't even connect to it because of a serious flaw. Throughout the story, Mattie Ross is a 14 year old girl. Then at the end it fastforwards 25 years. At this time Mattie Ross should be 39 years old and Cogburn would be well into his 80s. The woman who played Mattie Ross really shocked me. I had to look her up because she looked like she was at least 60 years old, but she happens to be only 41. Maybe women didn't age as well back then, but due to current society, I had trouble connecting. Also, with the time period it just didn't seem to click with me that Cogburn, a sheriff that always was in the line of danger, would live to be in his 80s back in the Western days and retire to a Western road show. It was just completely out of character and hard to believe he would live that long.

Overall, I found it to be a great film, just not nearly as good as the original, which is fine because topping a John Wayne film is near impossible. We must remember John Wayne also won the Oscar that year for his performance in True Grit. I thought the cinematography was wonderful in the remake and most of the acting stellar as well. The Coen Brothers are geniuses, but what I've grown to love about them seemed quite absent in this film. I can't wait until they go back to their old quirky stuff. I definitely think it was a thumbs up film, but Oscar worthy? I don't think so.

And that thread is for advice.  Here goes:

I'm currently 25 years old, living at home with my mom.  We split the mortgage (which she has recently refinanced to stay afloat).  My mother receives a non-taxable paycheck to look after 1 person with a mental disorder for the government.

I work full time, and I give her 500$ a month for rent, buy my own groceries.  My dad left her 5 years ago, and she's been downward spiraling ever since.  

It's not just the emotional side of things (which she copes well with on most days) but when he left her, he left the house and all the bills at the same... basically walked away from all the responsibility.  He currently lives with his well-to-do mother, has already saved enough money for retirement, and uses his new-found income to go on vacation about 4 times a year.

My mother is 63 years old, and she is getting a job at a call center working full time to help make ends meet.  It makes me so angry and disappointed that my Dad can just walk away, and he is basically set up to inherit my grandmother's estate-- meanwhile my mom fights tooth and nail every day to hold on to the last piece of property that her father left to her.

She's still in love with him, and can't afford a lawyer for divorce or alimony or spousal support.

250553,"I know there are enough people on Reddit and enough people not washing their hands after using the toilet (I see more not washing their hands in public then I see washing their hands) that one that does both will read this. So I'm just wondering. Why? Laziness? Disgusting personal hygiene (I've seen very clean cut people not wash their hands). Some religious reason? The number one reason I hate using public toilets is cause I'm always following some happy ass-hole (that become very offended when challenged) out that did not wash after.

**Edit:  This bothers me mostly cause i have a small kid that gets sick a lot more often now that he's doing the toilet thing himself (I make sure he's washing his hands), but before this I found it to be lazy (how long does it take to wash your hands, oh no the loss in time from your day) and disgusting (whatever method you use to avoid touching yourself when using the bathroom the rest of its not to clean either).
Some body asked how often I see people not washing their hands, I went one week at my work washroom without seeing one person wash their hands, probably 50 or 60 people.**

**Edit 2:  So I guess it comes down to perspective for a lot of people, one mans ""Ewwe that's disgusting"" is another mans ""You're just OCD'ing counsel that shit out of you""  I just wanted to an idea from others perspectives and now I have it.
That some said noticing 50 people not wash their hand is a little strange which I understand, what I have to say is high traffic washroom, and two trips a day (there can be as many as 20 other people using the washroom I use while I'm there), and when you don't hear the taps even once, it adds up quick, it's not like I stand there counting people that wash and those that don't**",-1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I've settled somewhat on an AR-15, but I'm having a good deal of trouble putting one together that has what I want, isn't some bargain bin piece of crap and doesn't completely break the bank. So far, this is what I've got, and it's basically pieced together from a Del-Ton rifle kit. It's the cheapest I could find and came recommended.

Del-Ton flat top upper, 20"" chrome lined barrel, standard front sight post post (I'm actually fond of it, but open to suggestions if someone has something better), Magpul MBUS rear iron sight, Del-Ton completed lower and a Magpul MOE carbine stock.

All told, it comes out to $760, assembled. I'm not really looking to put the upper together, and it wound up being around 30 bucks to just buy the lower completed from del-ton, an expense I'm comfortable with. Is there a way to build this gun cheaper without sacrificing quality? It's pretty no-frills as is. Even the Magpul stock was the same price as the standard A2 stock that it comes with, and the MBUS was as cheap as I'm willing to go on a rear sight.

Any advice is appreciated, and by all means if you have some suggestions, lay them on me. As an addition, is anyone familiar with Fail Zero's product? Is it bullshit? Would a chromed BCG do me just as well for $50 instead of $250?

It was a little rainy so I decided to do it under staircase where people mostly(exclusively?) go to get high. I've never seen anyone there but today a homeless guy down on his luck happened to be chilling there too. I said ""hi"" and everything and proceeded to light my joint; I even offered him some but he said it gives him a headache. 

His name was Aaron, 37 yo. He talked a little bit about how crack's ruined his life. He says he just craves it all the time like it's taken over his life. The hardest drugs I've tried were heroin and cocaine. I didn't get addicted to either of them. Once I tossed away my roach and just about to leave he asked me for spare change. I felt kinda bad for the guy so I give him about $4-$5 in change. And I asked him for a toke from his crack pipe. He warned first that he doesn't want to fuck me over and turn my life upside down but I assured him I was gonna be okay.

Took two hits. And before I left I introduced myself to him. told him it was cool meeting him. I didn't get too high from the crack. But I did feel some stimulation and numbness on my lips and tongue. 

This is something that I probably will never divulge to anyone I know. But I don't regret doing it at all. I'm not asking anyone to tell me if what I did was okay or completely fucking weird. But instead I'm just trying to share this story with you guys since I can't tell anyone else =/

254531,"I was wondering if anyone had advice on how to begin accumulating some political experience while still in college, with the ultimate goal being landing an entry level job working in government upon my graduation.

So far I've volunteered for two senatorial campaigns, but my experience has been essentially relegated to phone banking and holding signs out on the streets.  I've made a few contacts, but so far I haven't been able to parlay them into anything further.

I'm facing a few challenges, which makes getting involved a little more difficult:

1.  I go to an engineering college, and most of the students and facility there aren't particularly politically motivated.  Its difficult to make connections on campus versus a liberal arts school.  Also, I have little guidance on how to break into the field.  Everything I've done I've had to figure out on my own.

2.  I began college as an engineering student, but unfortunately I was pretty terrible at it.  Although my grades have improved since switching to business I still have a 2.6 GPA, which disqualifies me from the internship programs offered by senators and representatives (they generally require at least a 3.0).

3.  I'm from Connecticut originally, so I'm fairly liberal.  I go to school in Georgia, which is pretty conservative.  It's been difficult to find candidates to work for that share similar values as I do.

I don't mean to use these challenges as excuses for not moving forward, I just want to provide a little background.  If you have any suggestions, or have any personal experience you can share, I look forward to hearing from you.

I've been drinking casually once in a while at home or with friends and just want to get a little head start on my drinking prowess before I go for that first night at the bar. Don't worry, I'm going for quality over quantity here and just want to gain from the collective knowledge you guys and gals have gathered.

I just wanted to know about different kinds of straight liquor and what are some good ones to get/look for at different stores when I have the chance/money/gullibility/stupidity to do so. Also what mixes are fun things to drink/make. Sunny D and Rum anyone? It's so good, I can't get enough.

http://tinyurl.com/367vvg3

My current drinking knowledge is shallow. So far I realize that SoCo, Cognac, Jameson, and Bacardi + Coke are absolutely delicious. 

I'm not a big fan of beer, perhaps because the best thing I've had is Sam Adams Oktoberfest and Blue Moon. Although they were good I have never really been keen to go for a beer rather than some harder fare. I guess it's just a preference such as people who prefer espresso to coffee. 

I just want to find some good brands or types of drinks that would be a good experience for me. I've heard that scotch is heavenly and smooth, but never have had any myself. Cognac is a personal favorite because of how sweet it is and how light it feels when not on fire. I also have tried Limoncello imported from Italy (My family has a distant cousin who is a nun in Sicily, and wouldn't you know it she likes to PARTY HARD and likes a spot of Limoncello with her dinner rather than wine when she visits us in the U.S.) and I have to say it was great.

Also, there's this place near my humble abode called the ""Fat Cat"" that makes some drinks that sound like they would taste Godlike. I haven't had them yet, but they looked like the kind of thing that you could make at home and get all your friends coming over every weekend for if you got the mixes right. Don't believe me? See for yourself and tell me what you think (Check the Coctails section towards the bottom of the page).

255439,"I was raised as a typical middle class non-denominational protestant Christian in the American bible belt. Love thy neighbor (unless they are homosexual or otherwise ungodly), love god, abstinence, pro-life, anti-homosexual, Republican, etc. As one would expect, I had christian friends, went to church every Sunday and made lots of nonsensical, irrational arguments to people who disagreed with me.


Then puberty hit. I started to want to do many things that I had been strictly told were evil, poisonous acts. So, I repressed. And repressed. Eventually I got to those teenage rebellion years and with them came the desire to disagree with anything told to me by authority. So, long story short, I lost my virginity when I was 17. And I hate to admit it but afterward I was torn up inside, almost on the verge of tears. I began to ask myself why I would be given such a strong desire to do things that are clearly stated as sin. Eventually I blamed god. I rebelled. I figured I had found a loophole in god's rules and as long as I continued to believe I could do whatever I wanted and still make it to heaven. I felt horrible and guilty all the while, but my desires would never go away.


Fast forward about a year. At this point, I'm starting to question. I'm starting to doubt. I know there is all this information available about the true nature of things around me but I refused to investigate. The truth is, I was scared. I didn't want to be convinced that the Christian god wasn't real because if I stopped believing then I would be headed straight to hell. Eventually I couldn't help it any more and I began to research. I rationalized this by telling myself that I wanted to ""see how stupid it was"" or ""understand my opponents position."" In the end, being an intelligent and logical type of person, reason beat out indoctrination. 


Almost three years later and here I am today. I maintain a position as an agnostic atheist who, while open to the idea of higher beings, understands that there is no proof of existence of a god/gods and all religions that have existed to this point are inaccurate representations of a deity. I think critically and hold my life and the lives of my fellow man above all things. Essentially, I have become a productive member of humanity looking to improve the world as a whole rather than hold it back. This all started with me wanting to rebel against god. 


I guess what I'm trying to say is that when someone claims to rebel against god is not the time to scoff at their beliefs. Guilt is a powerful emotion and I believed in god more during that period of rebellion than I had at any other point in my life because I felt like he was actively judging me. At least in my case, this is the time to talk, in a calm and thoughtful manner, about the believers views.


In closing of this extremely long winded babbling, my point is that these people need to realize why their guilt does not originate from a god but from the sect of society that they were raised in. Atheism is not the end goal. An agnostic theist can be just as humanistic as an agnostic atheist. As long as people are thinking critically about morality and the causation of actions and not clinging to archaic rulebooks then society can move forward as it should. 


**tl;dr** I babble about my personal life for a little bit before getting to my point: Those rebelling against god generally feel guilt for their actions due to their belief in their specific god. If they are spoken to, not argued against, about these beliefs they may come to realize (as I did) that they have nothing to feel guilty about and can start to better understand the nature and needs of humanity, whether they remain theistic or not.",1,-1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Any ways, I'm running Vista 32-bit, and whenever I play PC games or Flash Games, or anything else Flash based, (it also seems to mess up in Photoshop.) my arrow keys and space bar don't work at all.

256613,"TL;DR

I’m a 22-year-old guy in an LDR (3 hours away). My girlfriend is getting stressed about the distance, and pressuring me to make definitive statements about our future and getting married. Only problem is, she’s cheated twice. I can’t bring this up to her because then I’m harping on the past.

I should probably break up with her, but she was my first everything, and I have some trouble making friends. I have zero experience with dating, and I’m not looking forward to being very alone. She’s also very beautiful (way out of my league), and this doesn’t make it easy to talk to her about breaking up. She’s very serious about our relationship and she’s always seen her future with me since she met me. Meanwhile, we don’t fight, but we don’t have a lot in common, either. Especially when I get close to thinking about breaking up, she gets very affectionate and I try to solve our problems.

Obviously, I'm not in the right when I've felt this way for so long without telling her. But being honest about this would be the same thing as breaking up with her, and that's what I'm having trouble doing. I would love to just do this amicably, but that can't happen with her.

What should I do? Should I try to settle? Should I break up with her? Should I keep on keepin’ on? I just want some objective voices on this.

==

She is my first girlfriend. We started dating when we were 18, and we've been dating for three years. She was my first everything (first date, first kiss, everything). I wasn't her first anything: She'd had a few boyfriends, but only one serious one. She is way hotter than a guy like me could ever hope to date (again).

We met during freshman year in college while she was dating her first serious boyfriend (she'd been dating him for a year). We started hanging out with a few mutual friends, and eventually we had a talk. She told me she loved me and kissed me. I felt it was wrong, and I didn't kiss back. I broke off the ""friendship,"" and told her that her relationship with him needed to stand or fall on its own merits. We didn't talk that summer, but by september her boyfriend was out of the picture and we were dating.

She traveled abroad during spring semester that year. We didn't have too much trouble with the LDR until the summer (we live far away from each other during the summer). That summer, she started hanging out with a guy at her work, and she felt disconnected from me since we were so far away, and pressured about how fixed our future together seemed. I found out that fall that she'd kissed him (and basically fallen for him). She apologized profusely, but eventually shifted blame on to how disconnected we were, making me feel bad. I didn't break it off. Every time I would bring it up, she would accuse me of ""not letting it go"" and trying to make her feel bad.

We don't have a lot of activities or interests in common. We have inside jokes that we can laugh about, but mostly we get by on listening to each others' problems. Superficially, though, we're great: we can be very romantic and, when we get the chance, our physical relationship is positively amazing.

Fast-forward to almost three years into our relationship: she's come out to see with my family. I planned to talk with her about our future, or lack thereof. Somewhere between her smile, her romantic talk, the beach, and talking away our problems I get energized about our future for the first time since she cheated.

Then we get drunk. She's incoherent. I'm less so. She's waiting on a text from her friend (a girl) and keeps talking about it, but she's in no shape to read. I never would invade her privacy under normal conditions. But now, I read her phone. First text: ""Hi honey."" Not from me.

So as it turns out, after a party she accepted a ride home, or should I say to *his* home, from a (different) work friend, this one thirty years old (we're 22). She'd thrown up on her dress, so he gave her his to wear, and they slept in the same bed while he kissed her back. I'm supposed to believe that that's all that happened, and I almost do. The next couple of days, she texts him niceties back and forth like the above, and visits his house and hangs out with his kids (!) and watches TV with him. Then, she comes on vacation with me.

Amazingly, I don't dump her. Not amazingly, she apologizes but ""explains"" herself and tries to excuse her behavior, and then gets mad at me for reading her texts. Again, god forbid I bring it up ever again; I must just ""let it go.""

We were staying with my parents at the time, and they basically figured everything out. They already had a bad feeling about her, but now they know everything, and they don't like her to say the least. (Meanwhile, her family is crazy about me.)

We had a big talk in september, where I tried to talk her into either breaking up amiably or taking a break. I discussed our problems (instead of saying ""cheating"" I say something about how disconnected we get when we're apart, how we don't talk about anything substantial, etc.). It becomes clear after a LONG talk that if we break up, it won't be amiable and it will be my fault. She equates taking a break to breaking up, so I try to talk her into a ""probation period."" Still too serious-sounding. Nothing changes.

It's now a few months later. We're both graduated, she has a job, and I'm in grad school three hours away. She's hating being so far apart, but she loves playing ""house"" when she visits me in my apartment. She has friends at home, but no eligible guys at her new job. Now she's saying that time is running out: she wants to know from me that we have a future together, that we're going to get married. Her friends are getting married and her relatives are asking about us.

She can be really romantic and really passionately sexual, and she is especially this way when I'm less enthused about our relationship. (Most of the rest of the time, she's just unhappy.) Seeing her face still entrances me. I'm a problem-solver, and I like to work things out. I don't want her walking away and vilifying me. But I think marriage would be a really bad idea, if only for the fact that she'd get miserable pretty quick, if history is any indication!

She has had some trauma in her life; she lost her mother when she was young. I don't think she's been single for more than a few days since high school. Meanwhile, I didn't know any girls in my all-boys high school, and I'm not a very interesting person: I've successfully cut myself off from my bad habits and interests (video games, television, cracked.com, etc.), but I haven't been super-successful at replacing them with new ones. I have some friends at school, but I range somewhere between ""a little"" and ""only somewhat"" socially awkward.

I would be giving up romance, sex, and someone who knows me pretty well, and I might not get anything like this again for a very long time. Of course these are terrible reasons to stay with someone, but sometimes I wonder if I shouldn't just settle and do my best. Sure there are a lot of people out there, but there are some people who just don't find the right person ever.

Part of the problem is that I am a problem-solver: I mend things up between people and make things okay again. I am pretty sure any break-up couldn't be amiable, so that means I would have to look at that face of hers and tell her we're over. This is very difficult.

Plus, obviously, I really care about her and I don't want to hurt her. This is tough all around.

257764,"So I picked up this book, “Zero: The Biography of a Dangerous Idea” by Charles Seife, at Fry's the other day and started reading it this morning at 3AM. Pretty interesting stuff. What struck me the most out of the first few chapters was how Western civilization just banished away the concept of zero and infinity because of religion and philosophy. The story goes something like this: the Greeks had a philosophical belief against zero as it represented the void and the infinite, two unacceptable concepts.

Pythagoras killed Hippasus over the concept of zero, seeing it as dangerous because it ruined the natural beauty of rational numbers. Then Aristotelians, Atomists, and the Eleatic school had this huge three-way fight over whether zero and infinity could not exist, whether it existed, or whether zero and infinity were the same. And then the Aristotelians won because the lack of infinity would prove the existence of God, fitting into later Western civilization; to question the non-existence of zero was questioning the existence of God.

But then zero is the fundamental concept in Calculus; zero defines the limit. In the most basic form, motion can be defined as an infinite number of zero-length steps. The sum of these steps is not zero, but it’s actually a number; this is the limit. Because zero was paramount to being atheist, and that was a big no-no in Europe, Calculus wouldn’t get invented until the 17th century when scientists such as Newton and Leibniz started questioning the religious doctrines.

So all the religious-right groups could be stifling the next great mathematical (or I guess, biological/physical?) discoveries much like the Greeks and the European churches stifled the discovery of Calculus (though I'm sure many AP Calculus students would love to not have Calculus around)",-1,-1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

259149,"""So why do most men avoid church? Here’s the veneer-stripped-away answer: going to church for the majority of men is an exercise in unwanted effeminacy. Church, for most men, has not only become irrelevant; it has also become effeminate. Hanging out in church for most Y chromosomes seems unmanly, and most men more than anything want to be masculine! 

The current lack of strong men within the Church, both in the numeric and leadership sense, has crippled our cathedrals and has helped devastate our nation ethically. The masculine spirit being absent from the pulpit, the pew and subsequently the public square has not only slowed down the forward progress of the Church, it has also weakened our nation’s morality, increased our country’s secularity, and has assisted (owing to our absence) the lascivious Left’s re-definition of life, sex, marriage and law. 
If the body of Christ wants to biblically improve our nation, then church has got to eliminate its effeminate drift and establish a masculine bent. Our times demand strong men and the church should be producing them and not repelling them.""

259692,"Hi reddit, throaway for obvious reasons. Anyway, here's the story.
So I started talking to this girl on okcupid about Dec 20th. Between then and now we've sent over 30 long and funny messages to each other, it seemed like it was going really well. She was being receptive, laughing at my jokes, and initating contact with me. I asked her to coffee and she said it would probably be best to meet up after the whole christmas season thing winds down, that was fine. I even got her phone number and we were texting back and forth as well. It really looked like she was genuinely interested in meeting, if nothing else.

Then she deleted her account, basically in the middle of our conversation. She never said she didn't want to meet, she never implied that she was not interested. It was probably the most promising string of communication I've had with a woman in a long time. I sent her a text asking if she was still up for coffee, nothing back. Haven't heard from her since then. That's fine, things happen.

But I don't exactly want to leave it there. If she didn't want to meet me, she could have said so and I wouldn't be too upset about it. Here is the creepy part...

Bear with me here. 
I want to go by her workplace and bring her some flowers and just ask if she'd still be willing to go for coffee. If she tells me no and to ""fuck off creep"", that's fine, she'll never see me again. No big deal to me. The part I am worried about is.. she never really explicitly told me where she worked. I have a friend who met her a few years ago and recognized her from the picture she had up, that's how I know where she worked. I know, creepy. 

I was going to say ""Hey, I know this is weird and creepy and stuff but I wanted to know if you were still interested in doing coffee sometime. If not, I understand and you will never see me again, it was nice talking to you.""

I can understand that this would generally be perceived as a creepy stalkerish thing to do. I have no intentions of ""stalking"" this girl, I have better things to do with my life. She's really interesting and we have lots in common and I just want to know why she stopped communicating. 

My question is, would any ladies find a well dressed professional guy (Mid 20's) coming by their work unannounced with flowers and asking them to coffee romantic? 
If I get an overwhelming negative response to this post, I will completely abandon the idea. 

Edit: Would prefer responses from ladies...

Today I noticed that after being on the machine for a while my monitor decided to just go out.  I tried replugging the DVI connector, fixing the LCD screen, everything...but no luck.  So I tried restarting my machine and this time the fans turned on to full speed, but I never got my POST beep (nor any visual output).

It seems like there may be a PSU problem going on, but I'm not sure...especially since all of my fans turn on and the DVD drive will eject.

Can anyone help my diagnose this further?

Looking for some tips and tricks for use of ULONG/USHORT in C - if statements, how do they work? Especially since I'm not really sure if the values are, for example, ""06"" or just ""6"", so if I wanted to do a comparison would it be ""if (MYUSHORTVAR == 06)"" or would it be ""if (MYUSHORTVAR == 6)""; I think it would be the latter, but any tips would be nice.

Plus, what are the right ways to do printf/dbgprint outputs of these types? All I know is I can use %d OR %02u, while %02x works with UCHAR.

Finally, I'm using a RAND() function and it's not...random at all. It's 100% predictable. What's up with that? I did #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;...

Exact line of code is: 

ChannelNumb = (USHORT)((11*rand()/RAND_MAX+1.0))); //gen a random integer between 0 and 11, then convert to USHORT type.

This is ALWAYS making a 0 first, then a 6, then a 2, then an 8. Not really random. Why?

Here's the scoop and the reference apocrypha on Jesus' first murder at the tender age of 5.:

http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/infancythomas-c-roberts.html

Chpt 4.  Second paragraph.

And when Jesus was **five** years old, there fell a great rain upon the earth, and the boy Jesus walked up and down through it. And there was a terrible rain, and He collected it into a fish-pond, and ordered it by His word to become clear. And immediately it became so. Again He took of the clay which was of that fish-pond, and made of it to the number of twelve sparrows. And it was the Sabbath when Jesus did this among the boys of the Jews. And the boys of the Jews went away, and said to Joseph His father: Behold, thy son was playing along with us, and he took clay and made sparrows, which it was not lawful to do on the Sabbath; and he has broken it. And Joseph went away to the boy Jesus, and said to Him: Why hast thou done this, which it was not lawful to do on the Sabbath? And Jesus opened His hands, and ordered the sparrows, saying: Go up into the air, and fly; nobody shall kill you. And they flew, and began to cry out, and praise God Almighty. And the Jews seeing what had happened, wondered, and went away and told the miracles which Jesus had done. **But a Pharisee who was with Jesus took an olive branch, and began to let the water out of the fountain which Jesus had made. And when Jesus saw this, He said to him in a rage: Thou impious and ignorant Sodomite, what harm have my works the fountains of water done thee? Behold, thou shalt become like a dry tree, having neither roots, nor leaves, nor fruit. And immediately he dried up, and fell to the ground, and died.** And his parents took him away dead, and reproached Joseph, saying: See what thy son has done; teach him to pray, and not to blaspheme.

So then he returns and tells me to follow him to some alley way and tries to assure me he knows his shit in really bad english. we get to the alley and he starts packing my nugget in his ghetto aluminum foil crackpipe bowl. we start walking down all sketchy-like, and hit it a couple times. we then get near the end and i hit it, and realize theres a cop stationed RIGHT in front of us. 

so then we turn around and i notice we had been smoking in front of another cop. i dont know how shit works here, but i freak out because its minimum 15 years here in the philippines, so we start walking back, with me pacing quickly and sketchy-like haha. we get back to his shop and he insists on giving me skimboarding lessons (and its like 9pm and i have jeans/shoes on) so im like nahhh im gonna go to a bar and get some brews

i say thanks and dip the fuck away from sketchy-mcgee. so im like [4] and walking down the strip and this filipina bartender that served me and my atv instructor drinks earlier calls out my name. she says there's a fire show on the beach, and i look into her tent setup, and theres hookah and sweet couches and a decently priced bar menu, so im like yeaahhhh

i sit down get some shots and some beers and burn like 40 minutes waiting for the fire show. looking around, im the only one just chilling since most other people came with friends from home. it wasnt a very social scene so i just chilled forever arone. then the fire-dancers start preparing and i notice one of them looks like a tranny, and then there was a dude, and a chick. all of them dressed in tight tiny spandex outfits. 

all the while, im getting twisted, smoking a cig, and jamming the fuck out to the techno they were blasting. the show then starts and its really fucking intense. they were spinning the fire balls and it was pretty cool, and then the dude lights my cig by spinning the fireballs in my face. after the song finishes, he sits next to me, and in starts talking to me. 

im not really sure if it was in a filipino hospitality way, or if he was hitting on me, but it was awkward nonetheless. then they continue their show and i cheer with the crowd when the girl dancer unzips her outer layer when she got hot from spinning giant balls of flame around herself. the dude dancer sits back next to me again, and points out that she is in fact a ""ladyboy"" and comments on how convincing zie looks lol

then the ""girl"" starts dancing in front of me and waving her ass in my face and sits down and same kind of weird filipino hospitality and/or hitting on me. zie and the dude both tell me they wanna party with me after the show, and im nice so im like ""yeah sure sounds cool dude."" then the finale of the show happens and they put a chair on stage. 

then the ""girl"" pulls me from the crowd and starts dancing against me, sits me on the chair, kisses my cheek, and then the dude starts waving the flame balls all around me as apart of the show. i pay my bill after the finale and go to the bathroom. 

they then intercept me en route and insist i go party with them. me still being nice, im like ""uhh yeah sure!"" so then i go piss and stealth my way out of the area. i then packed some nugget into the tip of my cig, smoke it in front of another cop, and chill on the beach staring at the stars at a [5]. so yeah, it was an interesting and fun and weird night. shit like that only happens when you are high 

TL,DR: Tried to score weed on a Filippino island. Sketchy shit ensues. Tranny fire-dancers decide they like me and give me strange amounts of attention. I have fun and go about my business and stare at stars while twisted, and good times were had by all.

264621,"Note: This is a DA (does anyone) post, not a DAE (does anyone else) post because I don't really stay updated with pro sports.

I love playing sports, but I think the whole fascination with watching professional sports games, keeping up to date with the teams/athletes, and deriving joy/sorrow from their accomplishments/failures is stupid. I don't mean this in a condescending way. I mean I understand it to a certain extent. I go to a college with a great football team and when my team is playing on TV, I'll usually try to catch at least the ending of the game. But honestly the only reason I watch the games is because 1. everyone else watches them so watching itself tends to be a social event 2. people will think I'm a loser if I didn't know that yesterday we won or lost to [insert significant team]. After I graduate, I'm 99% sure I won't even make the minimal effort anymore. 

Also I can only tolerate watching my *college* team play now. The other day I was watching my home NFL team play and I was bored to death. I literally couldn't care less about how well (or in my case, how *bad* they're doing since the Redskins suck) my NFL team is doing. I cared when I was like 9-14 years old and it was all new to me, but after seeing so many seasons go by and so many new players come and go, I don't understand how anyone can still give a shit. The exception being if we're close to winning a Super Bowl or something. But even that probably gets old after the first time. When Randy Moss is on some team that's not the Vikings and Michael Vick isn't on the Falcons, something just doesn't feel right to me. 

Somewhat irrelevant tangent:
*Or maybe it's just because I hate American football and think it's the dumbest sport ever. But hey I'm biased, I'm naturally a skinny featherweight so I have 0 potential to play competitive football. Even if I was extraordinarily athletically gifted, I would never make it in the NFL, or even the NCAA, because I'm 5'10 and 140 lbs. Take any random overweight slob and at least he has the potential to be a lineman or something.*

But even when it comes to college sports, I don't know nearly enough to hold my own in a conversation. It's real awkward when someone you don't know well mentions something like ""Omg Alabama beat blah blah Oregon blah blah [insert athlete name you've never heard of] blah"" and all I can do is nod my head in blissful ignorance. 

Up till now I haven't given a fuck. Why keep up with sports if I don't care about it? But I've realized that just about every single man (at least at my school) keeps up with it. If you're being introduced to someone, even if you have absolutely nothing in common, you can usually still bond over sports because nearly everyone pays attention to it. Some of you are probably thinking ""ok, so what?"" For a lot of you, it probably doesn't matter. But it could potentially be really helpful for networking and meeting new people. The benefit of having good relationships isn't to win some bullshit high school popularity contest, it's that you'll get opportunities that you normally wouldn't like getting the hookup to jobs. I can remember numerous occasions where I've dined with adults who could've gotten me a job at their company and they've started talking about sports. Having the sports knowledge would've definitely come in handy then.

Anyways, I'm just wondering how many people keep up to date with sports only so that they can ""hold their own"" when the conversation topic switches to sports. I don't currently do this, but it would definitely benefit my life if I did.

264934,"Atheists generally have strong logical skills.  They are good at comparing religious doctrines against one another, finding holes and irregularities where they may exist.  They are also good at rejecting scientific claims that certain religions may make that directly contradict actual scientific evidence (e.g. that the Earth was created several thousand years ago).

By far, the most common atheist argument I hear is that there is no empirically verifiable evidence for the existence of God.  If there were some such evidence, atheists would convert; since there is not, they might as well believe in the Flying Spaghetti Monster or unicorns.

So, what I don't understand is how these atheists get away with not acknowledging that God, as He/She exists today, is a metaphysical entity, not a physical one.  As such, God's existence is *inherently* unable to be proven with physical evidence.  The question of God's existence, like other [metaphysical questions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphysics#Central_questions), *cannot be known with certainty*.  

Regarding metaphysical entities, one could either remain agnostic (e.g. ""I cannot know with certainty whether there is X, and I choose not to make a guess""), or one could take a stance one way or the other based on whichever makes most sense (again, not basing the judgment on presence or lack of evidence, since this is irrelevant for metaphysical entities).  So rejecting the existence of a metaphysical entity like God based on a lack of physical evidence is a *completely worthless* argument.

Am I missing something?  Why do atheists, who are generally otherwise intelligent and logical, miss this crucial argument?  Or do they know about it and choose to ignore it?

**TL;DR** God, as He/She exists today, is posited to be a metaphysical entity, so why do atheists constantly ask for physical evidence of God's existence?  [Metaphysical questions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphysics#Central_questions) cannot be answered with physical evidence.

**Edit 1:** Three commonly raised counterarguments, with my answers here for convenience:

* (1) If God (or any metaphysical entity) intervenes in the physical world (as Christians believe God does), then shouldn't these physical interventions be able to provide evidence of God's existence? 

*Response:* Metaphysical entities can have manifestations in the physical world. But that does not necessarily mean that the scientific method can be used to gather evidence regarding the entities' existence or non-existence.

If the metaphysical intervention leaves behind a [physically verifiable relic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miracle_of_Lanciano), the intervention of a metaphysical entity could be verified by science.

If not (as is the case with most alleged cases of metaphysical intervention, such as answering a prayer or affecting a temporary event), the science will be useless in evaluating the metaphysical entity.  Science works due to the ability to repeat physical experiments and achieve the same results. The source of the repeatability of scientific experiments is the physical laws that govern the action of physical entities. Metaphysical entities, by definition, are not constrained by physical laws, so they cannot be evaluated by the scientific method.  You cannot put a metaphysical entity ""to the test"" in the physical world, so you cannot evaluate it using physical evidence.

* (2) While there is no direct evidence against the existence of God, there is direct evidence against some things in the Bible, like God creating the Earth a couple thousand years ago.

*Response:*  Disproving a literal interpretation of something in the Bible does not disprove the existence of God, or even the existence of a God which inspired the Bible.  I am Catholic; in official doctrines, we accept evolution, reject young-earth Creationism, accept a heliocentric universe, etc.  Sometimes it takes us a little while, but we do not reject any scientifically proven facts.

* (3) OK, but why the Christian God and not some other metaphysical entity? 

*Response:*  This whole post is a counter-argument to the frequent atheist demand for physical evidence of God's existence.  This question falls outside the scope of what this counter-argument addresses.  There are other arguments available to address this question, but in the interest of keeping this focused let's save that debate for another day.

I got married, live a completely normal life (sort of mundane actually), but can't shake the thought that my wife and family were created to teach me something in some sort of holographic virtual universe-simulator.

266370,"I usually only browse, and have seen that this subreddit is very quiet about a significant portion of our population. Here are some provocative points about Muslims in India:

* India is a big country. But despite this huge size, there is something that binds Indians - Muslims have problems everywhere. If there are [Muslims in Ladakh](http://english.pravda.ru/news/world/10-02-2006/75745-india-0/), they have trouble with Buddhists. Muslims in [Kerala](http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/pdfid/4b6fe2482.pdf), at the other end of the nation, will have trouble with Christians.  Hyderabadi Muslims have constant friction with Andhrites, historically as well as in the present day ( one of the most constant sights is riot police near Charminar and other areas of old city). 

    Apart from external threats, what binds India is the trouble its non-Muslims have with Muslims. Parties like BJP and others ignore this at their own peril. A thriving and ghettoized Muslim community is a important part of a united India. All we need is more riot police. 

* Indian Muslims use ""Muslim"" names. Except they forget to tell you that there is no dictionary of Muslims names that comes as appendix A to the Koran. Indian Muslims just like to use Arab names to differentiate themselves from the rest of the Indians. Arundhati (Ray) is a Syrian Christian, but her parents did not name her Elizabeth, or any ""Christian"" name. They named her after the language of her parents, which was Malayalam or Sanskrit. Ok, people like Salman Khan may have Turkic heritage, so he is a Khan - makes sense. But 80-90% of Indian muslims are not Arabs or Turks, they are like anyone else. But they insist on calling their kids Arab/Turkic names.

    India lost a lot of wars from muslims invaders; no wonder people want to follow the example of the the winning team rather than the losing team.    

* The Sachar Committie report. Lets see - you have population growing at 40-50% faster than the rest of the population, and you expect your average income of Muslims to keep up with the rest of the population? What the hell are these people smoking? Do they know what average means? If Muslims have more kids than the other people, and if they grow at the same rate, their average wealth and income WILL lessen. 
 
    The recommendations of the Sachar committie mean nothing more than the fact that the rest of the nation will subsidize each third kid  from a Muslim family. You know, that little Akbar? You will pay for his upkeep. If you do not, be prepared for more rioting ( isn't that the reason Muslims are getting special reports? Otherwise Biharis are poorer. Even your average UP'ite is poorer than the average Indian Muslim).

* Does anyone know from where did the movement of Pakistan get its maximum support in the 1930s and 1940s? In present day Bihar, UP and other such parts of present day India. Your average Muslim politician in UP, in those decade was a leader of the Muslim league, and wanted separate electorate, and when that did not satisfy them, a separate nation. 

    Thats history. How it affects us today is how these guys then asked for separate civil code, at the threat of more violence, and got it. Nehru, Ambedkar et al had no other option. 

    A common law is a necessity of a nation - as long as we don't have same laws, we are not a nation. Personally, I have no loyalty to this make-believe ""nation"", and I advise you too desist from false patriotism. Save as much taxes as you can, of those who are not wage slaves. Wage slaves are fucked anyway - but you can help others by not insisting on a bill, so they save on some VAT. 

* Guess the only state with Muslim majority in India. now guess the only state where people and leaders have shown a preference to get out of India for the last 50 years. Its the same state - or more correctly the region of Kashmir. (Personally I believe they should be allowed to go out - why insist on keeping them with us? To further the sense of false nationhood? Suckers believe that Kashmir is integral to India. It is not).

Here's my understanding of the paradox:

Free Will - The power of acting without the constraint of **fate**

Omniscience - Knowing everything.

So, let's presume there exists a being with free will and there exists a being with omniscience. The free willed being will make choices; the omniscient being knows what the free willed being will choose before said being can make said choices. The outcomes of these choices are thus **fated** to happen. Therefore any choice the free willed being makes can be said to be governed by fate, not free will.",-1,-1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I'm sitting on a plane. It's Christmas. It's a 5 hour flight.

There is NO INTERNET.

I'm concerned. I have a smart-phone with always-on internet
access and a quota that I don't hit. I have fast internet
access at home.  The thought of being able to do my job
without a live connection the internet is pretty laughable.

read my email, check the news, check the weather radar to

I am, where I'm going, and figure out how to get from A to
B on public transport, and if B is even going to be there

I watch on demand across the intertubes. I'm pretty much
taking for granted that if the internet is there, I can find
something to do if I'm bored, and the internet is always there.

can just watch it on my laptop. Hehehehe. Suckers. Wait.

been meaning to catch up on. Uhoh. Those articles are on the
Internets. This is becoming a problem.

access for granted for pretty much wherever I am (apart from
the gaps between stations going through the city-circle under

268012,"Let me break it down for you, using cold hard logic.

The theories of determinism and indeterminism are opposites. The first theory says that everything that happens in a system (i.e., the universe) is determined by the prior state of that system. The theory of indeterminism states that what happens in a system is *not* determined beforehand.

Simply put, determinism thinks that every event in a system (including human actions) is determined by the prior state of said system, just as simply as a ball rolling down a hill. Indeterminism thinks that these events are not completely determined by the prior state of the system; that there is more than one possible outcome in a system.

By the very nature of these two theories, one **must** be true, and the other **must** be false.

If determinism is true, then all of our actions have been determined beforehand. Therefore, we cannot be credited with making our own choices, as the choices we make were predetermined for us; therefore, we have no free will.

If indeterminism is true, then we make our choices at random. If we make our choices at random, then we are unable to ever truly control ourselves. Therefore, we have no free will.

If you're like me, you would enjoy the occasional nonsensical humor, marvel at the ways the creativity is being expressed, cringe at the occasional gore, but in general it's bearable, at least as far as cesspools go.

On one of the *ism pages I noticed an ""Offended? Click here"" link. Well, what sort of penitence can ED offer? The worst kind. In particular, the worst shock page I have ever seen, both by quantity, quality and composition of images. Here's the page in question: [NSFL10. CODE 'RED HEART OF A BURNING SUN'](http://encyklopediadrammatica.com/Ofended%3F).

Link intentionally misspelled. Remember the times you said to yourself ""I should have followed that guy's 'do not click' advice"". Now is the time. Do not go there, and if you accidentally get there, do not scroll down, and make sure no never go there by mistake.

And, if you're fond of nonsentical humor, I present to you [Unicyclopedia](http://uncyclopedia.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page)!

271178,"Share some if you have some. They don't necessarily have to be love stories. A date, friendship, relationship, marriage, anything. It's sad, but it happens and I wanna hear people's stories and how they dealt with it.

**My story:**

I met this guy a few years back, let's say his name was John. John was a few years older than me and very intelligent. He had a stable job, amazing conversations, we laughed at everything and had a good time. He was a really shy guy at first, but that quickly changed the more we got to know eachother.

I was still a bit immature and he was very inexperienced with relationships and girls, so instead of talking about our feelings freely it was very passive aggressive but cute non the less. John was really quiet, but the time we spent talking was never awkward. I loved seeing him, I loved how shy he was on the phone, I loved the good morning texts and sweet dream ones. We were too young to be thinking about anything serious, so it was pretty much just puppy love.

John sometimes would tell me he had to go places, or couldn't talk right now. Every time I asked him where, he would make a joke out of it, change the subject and just assure me that it was a thing with family. (I knew he wasn't cheating because he really did go with his family.) I was too young and infatuated to worry or be scared of where he was going. 

The first time we broke up was after about a year, because he was unsure about us. When I wanted to talk to him, he'd tell me I was too clingy. When I didn't, he'd beg for me to talk to him. When I was acting affectionate, he's be distant. When I was distant he'd beg for my affection. I couldn't put up with it and I decided it was better to stop talking.

After a few months we decided to give it another try. But this time something was very different. He was a lot colder and a lot meaner. At first, it was little things. Asking me why I was atheist. Asking me what proof I had. Telling me I was wrong.

Then it started to get more serious. He told me while we stopped talking he looked seriously into his religion. He's a Jehovah's witness and never took it seriously before. All those places he went that he wouldn't tell me about? It was his family dragging him to church.

It would be fight, after fight. Religion didn't matter to me. I didn't bring it up. He would get more horrible and more scary. On the phone at night instead of talking and laughing together again he'd try to read me passages from the Bible. If I didn't want to hear it, he'd say I didn't care about his beliefs. He'd tell me how when he went to church and saw the ""happy couples"" praying he'd feel like crying because he knew he couldn't have that with me. It eventually escalated to him crying, crying about how we couldn't be together forever because I'd be going to Hell. Instead of cute notes or emails, it was things about God. I didn't want to hear it, and I told him. Eventually he brought the conversation about marriage, and said how he couldn't ever marry somebody who doesn't share his belief and his kids were going to be raised that way too.

That was the last straw for me. He was just trying to change me, and I wasn't going to change. I asked him ""So you would never marry me how I am right now? You're just waiting for me to change?"" and he said yes.

After that it was tears and tears. Memories of us being happy. Memories about our relationship before religion came into it. Our time spent together, our amazing conversations, how we agreed and disagreed on things, how nice and understanding he was. When he started taking religion seriously, that all went away. :/

**PS:** I realize this may be a little on the extreme side but.. just make sure if you ever date somebody religions they're content with you being atheist FOREVER. Not just waiting for you to ""grow out of it"" or convert.

Text to save you guys a click on the above:)

Years ago I saw what I think was webcomic that appeared to have just started, and I'd really like to dig it up again. I only remember two, both making light of ADHD. The strips went something like this:

(**SPOILER ALERT** by the way, in case it is found and people want to read the comics.)

* First panel shows a stand-up comedian on stage saying ""I have ADHD, and it's *bad*!"" (or similar)
* Second one shows the audience going ""how bad??"", thinking there's a joke coming.
* Last panel shows the stand-up comedian intensely occupied with playing Game Boy.

The second strip (very next one, I think) shows a guy reading the first strip and becoming outraged because he has ADHD as well. He starts to draft a letter to the webcomic author about it, but then the last panel he is searching for bunnies on Google image search, having forgotten whatever he was doing...

I thought they encapsulated ADD/ADHD incredibly well, and I'd like to find them again, but I have literally Googled for hours and I can't find them. I don't remember anything else from the webcomic, or even if it was a steady webcomic (and not just a couple of cute strips someone made), or names, etc. It was colors and nicely drawn though. So I'm praying someone here have seen these and knows what I'm talking about.

272950,"I was wondering if drugs are ever used to try to correlate brain anatomy with function. Specifically, I was curious about ""ego death."" This is the phenomenon where an individual no longer thinks in terms of self and non-self. It's usually described as being ""one with the universe.""

The state can be induced with large doses of LSD-like substances, or moderate doses of salvinorin A. It can also be obtained spontaneously, through meditation, or some combination of drug and thinking (like a large amount of marijuana, with meditation.) However, a lot of LSD, or Salv.A are sure-fire methods. Ego death is different than a dissociative state (which Salv. A can also induce), where the individual feels a disconnect with their body.

Here's a state that can easily be induced and recognized, and is immensely different than normal experience. In other words, you can temporarily eliminate a pillar of folk psychology in someone.

So has anyone taken these variables and made experiments to try to illuminate the mechanisms underlying ego death? Even just at the abstract level? I'm not suggesting that these experiments will reveal a structure like Descarte's idea of the pituitary gland, or some other cogsci panacea.

Or, here's another question I'm not sure anyone's attempted to answer: why do deliriants produce true hallucinations? The vast majority of psychedelic visuals aren't true hallucinations, since the user can tell that serpents on the floor aren't real (even if it's unsettling). Hallucinations from deliriants (datura, Diphenhydramine, etc.) are indistinguishable from reality until they vanish. The delirious person will have conversations with people who aren't there, smoke invisible cigarettes, and more. It's not surprising that anticholinergic drugs would have a wide range of effects, but consistently creating phantasms? Why?

I'm positive fruitful research would come from trying to answer these questions using whatever is at cognitive scientists' disposal.


So why aren't these tools being used (or, why can't I find it with google scholar)? There are dozens of psychedelics with subtly different, yet consistent effects (in the right setting). I think it all boils down to the stigma associated with psychedelics.

The knit tie is the one thing I'll be returning for two reasons. A: it's a lot wider than the site let on (3 inches) and it just looks kind of silly for a knit tie to be that wide. B: it feels real flimsy. I have a knit tie from J. Crew and it has a corded rib going down the center that gives it a feeling of real quality, that is not in this one. They did put a bit of reinforcement on the back, which was nice but there's just something lacking in the quality of the business end of it.

The 1-inch tie bar is also of pretty good quality. One thing about it, is that it's incredibly small, but still quite noticable once it's on. It really completes the look of a shirt and tie without being too showy and looks great on a skinny tie. (I wear a lot of skinny ties due to the ill proportionate size of my neck and head.

I am really impressed with the purchase I made. A lot of times when someone says ""I spent 60 dollars on ties"" that means they paid for one tie. If anyone is into knit ties just remember that the quality of the knit is not their strong suit.

It wasn't very hard to see the similarities in strategies between LoL and DotA. But a couple things stood out to me. LoL seems a lot more action oriented than DotA, which is slower-paced. LoL seems to be balanced as far as individual heroes go, but not as far as hero genres/niches go. But the biggest difference to me was that items hardly ever have actives, or even passive-actives (things like orb effects or radiance in DotA.) So one game, I was playing as Ashe who I consider the most OP hero I've played so far. I was level 6 (in the ELO rankings, not in the game) i think, and we were losing slightly. The other team had a Kennen who had gone on some streaks but fallen off as the game went on. I told my team to do what I was doing and focus her in battles because she was the only one getting kills or really doing anything... Suddenly we won a team battle, pushed into their base and won... Then in the after-game room the Kennen started talking trash and saying that Ashe is an easy hero (which I don't disagree with) especially because I ended the game 16-4. But my question is this, If there are so many small things you can do in this game that are ""noob"" things to do and make the game easier, can it really be called a strategy game?

I am slightly red/green colorblind. I can see both colors mostly fine, but I have trouble seeing the difference when placing buildings. Especially on maps with a grass/green ground. When trying to properly wall off in the beginning this usually forces me to pretty much random-click and hope I didn't leave a hole where units may pass through.

The more and more I play the game I start to just *know* where to place the buildings. But it's a slow learning process. Some other games have options to resolve this problem. BFBC2 has a ""color blind"" option. So does Peggle. Even ET:Quake Wars allows you to change the colors how enemies/friends are shown. I haven't found anything similar yet in SC2.

It drives me insanely sad that developers don't allow for such a basic customization. Given that there is a such high percentage of colorblind people. Heck, it's a pretty fundamental rule in any user-interface (and even arbitrary presentation) design, to not solely rely on colors to convey information.

Has anyone else got similar problems? If yes, did you find a satisfactory solution?

Apparently she met him through one of her friends and they go to the same school (college) together.  My sister didn't finish high school and is finishing it through this college (another story..).  This man is a English major, in some band, a hopeless romantic, philosophical, and seems to run on emotion rather than logic.  

Maybe my view is skewed only for the fact that my sister has been with other men before that were of older age.  For example when she was 14 she was in a long distance relationship with a 21 year old, had dates with a few around her age, then dated another around 21 years old and happened to have an abortion, and now this man.  What am I supposed to do?  My parents do absolutely nothing.. they know about these situations but seem to let it slide.  Or maybe they just don't know WHAT to do and so they choose to ignore the situation.  I'm the only one moaning and groaning about all this.. maybe I'm just overreacting and need to calm down.  

Why does this person want to be with my sister?  Is it because no one at his age want to be around him?  And why can't he find another that are of his age?? Is my sister easy ..? (ugh probably.)

The PrototypeJS library has a massive collection of things like this (I used to use it a lot), however I didn't want to resort to using it since it would just add a lot of bloat that I don't need with its DOM functions, and I'm already using jQuery in most of my projects.

So, having not found what I was looking for, I decided to put together my own.  Currently it includes some basic string manipulation and validation methods, and the magnificent QuirksMode cookie functions.

So I was probably like you and kept looking around and reading up on this Amnesia: The Dark Descent game and heard it was the scariest game ever made. Well me being the pussy I am I wanted to learn as much as I could before I got into it. So I watched reaction video after reaction video and I looked at some game play and so on. 

Watching some footage of Amnesia is perfect, too much and you will become accustomed to it. I even watched some of those playthrough videos every now and then and killed some of the vital scares for me.

The main reason why Amnesia is so scary is the Immersion. I know it has been said every time Amnesia has been brought up but it is true! Play this game with Headphones, and in a Dark room! I played this game with headphones for most of it but the beginning sometimes I took them off. This killed all the sound and immersion from the beginning. Also, don't play while drunk, you will become cocky and not care and that is the opposite of what you want. 

I have beaten the game and by the end it was a cake walk for me. I didn't treat it like an experience, more a game I had to beat to say I beat it. THIS IS NOT ONE OF THOSE GAMES. I did everything I could just to beat the scary game it stopped being scary for me, and now there is no going back.

I keep my Droid (Milestone) in my pocket pretty much most of the day.  While listening to music the last few months, it would automatically pause when there was a ""large"" movement like sitting down or standing up.  More recently, it would automatically pause by the time I got it in my pocket so I had to carry it if I wanted to listen to music through the headphones.  After a bit of googling, I came across [this link](http://androidforums.com/motorola-droid/139325-3-5mm-jack-my-droid-total-crap.html#post1303454) which suggests spraying a bit of WD-40 in the headphone jack.  With nothing to lose, I gave it a shot.  The WD-40 seemed to come out pretty fast from the can, so I sprayed it in a separate container and then used a dropper to put about 3 drops in the headphone jack.  I plugged in my headphones and wiggled them around a bit and now everything's perfect.  I don't know if the headphone jack had just accumulated lint from my pocket preventing good contact with the headphones, but it was definitely a nuisance.

This was four months ago, but I posted and asked for photoshops of my friend jumping off a cliff. If you don't remember, he was the fat guy (see above).

The response was so overwhelming and so many quality shops were coming in that I waited until the day of his party to print the photos so I didn't miss an amazing 11th hour entry. I ended up picking my favorite 50 and printing them off as 4x6 photos at Walmart from a kiosk. Some cropping was necessary, but they turned out well. The photo section guy wouldn't come back from lunch early to ring me up, so I ended up being slightly late to the party and ditching the album and just gave him the photos. He loved them:

http://imgur.com/PK3jw

I took so long to post this because I thought I lost the two pictures above due to some SD card related phone shenanigans. They mysteriously reappeared recently and I saw them when I checked my gallery today for something else. I actually had about 10, most of which were better than these, but you can at least see the joy/embarrassment on his face.

I saved all of the shops and made a facebook album and tagged him in every single one, so all of his friends were able to see your handywork even if you didn't make it into the top 50 printed photos. There ended up being over 220.

My all time favorite was the Precious movie poster, but there were tons of amazing, funny, clever and awesome shops.

Everyone is welcome as long as they are respectful and they do not intend to drive drunk. You are not required to dress up or even know what neo-noir means, it's just something nice to tie everything together (and an excuse for me to drink Coca-Cola from a whiskey bottle).

I have a wet bar (I'll be making my signature cherry rum and Cokes as well as having a nice selection of beer and liquor), a Neo-Geo arcade cabinet, and cards (you're welcome to bring whatever games you want, especially something that fits with the theme). We will have some movies on in the background (Blade Runner, Sin City, other suggestions are welcome). If you need to crash at my place, you're welcome to, but you should probably bring a sleeping bag or blankets.

280821,"I'm not a virgin, but I might as well be considering how long it's been... I'm 28 and there is nothing more frustrating to me than watching all of the people I know get laid with *ease.* They all give me advice of course, here are some of the most common things I get from them:

* Get out more! (done and done)
* Go to a bar pick up a random girl and get your confidence back! (bars in the pacific northwest have almost nobody under 45 in them)
* Get a hobby, meet girls doing something you love! (took dance classes, and joined a gym)
* Go take a class at the junior college and meet a girl there! (classes were 80% male 18% female and 2% some weird semi-solid human shaped blob I could not identify) 
* Try some volunteer work, there are lots of girls there! (look at all these happy couples!) 
* Network, ask friends to hook you up with girls! (amazingly of the 40 to 50 people I regularly interact with nobody knows any single girls even close to my age, or they just don't really try that hard to ask around after I bring it up)
* Try online dating! (total disaster)
* Ignore women, don't think about them and it will just happen! (the smell of desperation is far more powerful than feigned disinterest, and women are like sharks, they can detect a single drop in a vast ocean) 
* Go get a hooker! (I'll pass...)
* Try a church! (from the same guy who first suggested a hooker ironically enough) 
* Get rich, women love money! (from a guy who has a steady girlfriend who pays all his bills...)
* Change how you look/act! (good idea, lets do this!)
* Change how you look/act! (after following the above item the first time)
* Just be yourself! (y u no tell me before?? i spend all  of money on new clothes!!!??) 

*le sigh*

I've tried *everything* on that list several times over except for getting a hooker, not for any moral reasons but simply because with my terrible luck I'm sure I would catch something permanent and then I'd ***REALLY*** have a hard time with the added complication of a nasty STD.

edit: and technically I guess I have not tried the ""getting rich"" one, but I do okay for myself, and some of my friends without jobs right now still manage to swim in a sea of vagina every night... 

Any other ideas? Obviously *I'm doing it wrong.*

**TLDR: 2010 sucked, anyone else feeling the same pain?**

edit2: I suspect part of the problem is the era my generation grew up in. Nobody in my high school was getting laid regularly, hundreds of kids, all scared shitless of sex due to years and years of being told how horrible all the consequences were without having any access to actual useful information. Brace yourselves kids, the internet did not exist at this time, no wikipedia, no websites designed to help kids with questions about puberty and sexuality in an open format. All we had was scrambled porn on channel 98 and 99 and an old JC penny summer catalog. A few lucky kids had a dad with a dusty playboy from 1973. 

The 90's: where even *looking* at a girl in a long sleeve flannel shirt and baggy jeans could make you **die from AIDS.**

Why is it other men want me more than my husband?  Why is it other men constantly ask to see me, be around me, but not my husband?  Why do I remain loyal to my husband after he cheated, after he lied, after he hurt me and after he broke every promise and vow?

Why am I alone again? Why am I going to bed and waking up alone? Why am I doing this...again? I don't deserve this.  I don't deserve to be lied to, I don't deserve to be betrayed, I don't deserve to be cheated on, I don't deserve to be treated like I don't exist.  I don't deserve to cry myself to sleep at night.  I don't deserve to wake up and wish I hadn't. I don't deserve to believe my husband would rather I be dead. 

No matter if I talked to him, he'd get mad at me.  He'd turn it on me, he'd blame it on me, he'd make ME feel bad.  I can't win and I never will.  If I try talking to him, he'll throw it back in my face and threaten to end things.  He'll tell me he ""doesn't want to deal with it and he's tired of it"".

X implies Y, Y implies X, or some as-yet-unknown Z implies both X and Y.  This should apply to the Euthyphro argument.  And therefore the question:

Is it possible that some other property could cause an action to be both moral and commanded by God?

284095,"Heres where I am supposed to introduce myself and give a brief about the story I am about to tell.

My insurance is due on the 15th of every month. I have had my insurance since September, this year. This month however, I was late. And not pregnant late, I was insurance late which turns out to be just as surprising. 
I moved to a new house on the 13th of this month and have been making preparations at my old place to hold true to my lease. You see, my landlord was a wacknut and I came across an opportunity I couldnt pass, so we moved quickly.
I could give a hundred excuses but for whatever reason I missed my payment. Infact, I forgot all the way until today, when I saw their commercial on TV. So at about 5:30pm today, I paid my insurance company. He insured (oh the laughter) me that I was all paid up and everything was sound. 
Great I thought, since I just washed all my laundry and needed to go dry it (dryer broke, I am not made of money... sad). So, my girlfriend, who I have lived with for over 2 years, and my best friend who is our roommate who we lived with for 4 months, came with to dry their clothes too! My girlfriend drove, I drove shotgun and my friend was in the backseat.
After we left, we saw a lot of cop lights up a street that was on our way to laundromat. Of course we drove by to check it out - this is where the problems start.
I saw a cop car leave the scene after they were a block behind us. He quickly flashed his lights and drove really fast through an intersection (4 way stop sign, mind you this is a small town / wannabe city) to get up behind us. He continued to be on our ass the whole way across the bridge to the other town where we moved from (1 mile).

He pulled us over just as we got to the other side. When he approached the car, he seemed upset for some reason and requested all of our IDs. He also confirmed my name and then asked if I got any mail recently, I told him no. He said well your registration is suspended, did you have any insurance that lapsed? I told no, in fact I just paid it not 10 minutes ago. He left and went to his squad car.

At this time we are trying to figure out exactly what the issue could be as the representative told me my insurance was reinstated. We discussed being late and I even told a cheesy story about what happened to cause me to be late. He went on to say the account is ok and that my next pay date was the 15th.

The cop comes back and tells me, ""I just got off the phone with a supervisor with your insurance and they told me they havent talked to you and your insurance has been out for 3 weeks. They said you did not make a payment and are pretty upset with you that the vehicle is registered to you and she has the insurance.""

I was baffled and started telling the cop that I just paid it not 15 minutes ago. The car is registered to me, but the person who drives it, has it insured. I am not a driver, so I am not listed. It even asks on the site that I signed up for it on who the vehicle is registered to, me. So the insurance is well aware.

He continued to tell me that he has to take the plate as PennDOT (PA drivers thing).  According to the [DMV of PA website](http://www.dmv.state.pa.us/pdotforms/fact_sheets/fs-inla.pdf), Your lapse must be more than 31 days to have your plate taken/surrendered. I was unsure of this at the time so I didnt say anything about it.

At this point I got out of the vehicle, hit redial and called the insurance co. I had a rep on the phone who could confirm everything and the officer wanted nothing to do with it. He went to his vehicle and the tow guy was off to work, on my car. Insane.

After talking with the tow guy, I convinced him to just tow to my house (1 mile away.....) instead of losing my car over the next 3 days (they are closed, holiday then sunday). Cost? $125.

The cop then comes out of his car and tried to justify what he was doing telling me people try to rip off insurance by insuring it and letting someone else drive, but I again told him... Only the insured is driving this vehicle. :/ He said that if we can get him proof of having insurance at that time, he can take of the potential $1000 fines (WTF?!).

As you know, I did follow up with the insurance company after I got my car home. The supervisor rep I requested to speak to, told me that my insurance is infact reinstated right after payment is received and she has no record of a supervisor talking to an officer, as the supervisors have to take notes when they speak to a cop. Hoping that the super was lazy, she was attempting to the find the rep that the cop spoke with. I demanded to speak with the supervisors supervisor (wtf?) but was unable to reach them tonight. 
The nice lady I talked to said she is going to send a fax to the cop letting him know when my insurance was reinstated. 
So at this point, I probably wont hear from the insurance until the morning... 

TL;DR - Got pulled over, cops call insurance, insurance lies and says i did not have insurance when i did. I call insurance and they state I do have insurance but cop doesnt wanna hear it, tows car anyway.

SO, who is responsible here? 

Me - Perhaps I should have not let my insurance lapse and predict the future instead of receiving proper phone calls / letters stating status changes

Cop - The law states 31 days, I was within the limit and he should not have taken my plate. He towed the car on the basis that the plate is no longer on the car, if he didnt take illegally take my plate, perhaps this wouldnt have been so...

Insurance - Why did they lie? :O


EDIT - already paid the $125..

EDIT2 - Just got off the phone with insurance. She could not believe the dodgy work of her reps! Her name was Janice (look at me getting names now) and she said she is talking to her Manager about the towing bill. She brought it up, not me. :D

He asked me 6 months ago for a divorce, then took it back the next day stating he may have spoken too soon, and I took him back.  Since then, we've been going through spurts of great, and fits of worse.  We've been trying to have more discussions and communicate, but it's been fairly obvious that we're not the same people we were when we started out together.  

Our biggest differences:  kids, rent vs own, amount/quality of time spent together, diet (near-primal vs likes the occasional grilled cheese w Kraft processed slices on thick whole-grain bread,  oooh and pasta, and dinner rolls...can you tell which one likes to indulge in carbs?), exercise (fun and unorganized vs regimented w goal-setting), acceptable time spent on WoW and other games, what to do with vacation, what to spend money on, spending time with family and friends, ease of communication (I currently work varied shifts so am not home at regular times, and he is very frequently decked out in a headset, talking with his guild, fighting in many raids and can't pause the game-WoW, I hate you for that-insert look of disapproval that I'm too lazy to find here).  

Blech, there are a lot of differences, but we did/do have a lot in common as well.

So, he's spending the night somewhere, and won't sleep here again.  He'll tell our friends tomorrow why we can't be at their New Years Eve party, and I'll tell my family/friends.  He'll look into the divorce papers (I cry A LOT, so would be pretty useless on a phone call).  We'll figure out what things need name changes for ownership's sake, and when/how moving his belongings out will go.

I hate that we have so many friends in common.  Most of our friends were his first, but we've gotten along so swimmingly that I also consider them mine.  How do you get around that?  I can't wrap my mind around it.

I'm also bummed that I've become a statistic of divorce.  My family is full of divorces, including my own parents, so I'm not unfamiliar with the good and bad that comes with separation, but I felt so strongly that we were meant for each other and it could never happen.

I'm torn between getting sucked into an abyss of despair or re-inventing myself and moving forward (I have an urge to paint and redecorate, or find a place closer to work and start fresh-but I have to keep in mind I'll be footing the rent very soon-though he's offered to help to make sure I'm ok).

Thanks for listening. :/  He's also a redditor, so I'll also need to consider leaving Reddit until I'm done hurting. 

TL/DR:  Divorced (well, soon-to-be).  Sad.  Worried.  Annoyed that there is no time machine to transport me to the future to show me that everything is going to be ok.  Thanks.

I'm a rails dev (well, actually I'll be managing the dev team when we actually have one) for a startup company which is in the final stages of getting funded. So far we've all been working for nothing and have been using komodo editor since it's good and it's free. Since we'll actually have a budget for these things soon, I've been thinking about what to use for myself and the people I need to hire. So far redmine is looking the best. I've also used aptana studio (radrails), eclipse with the radrails plugin (both were pigs).

Anybody have experience going through the process of testing out IDE's? Which ones did you like/dislike and why? What did you end up going with? We're looking to stick with windows, so no mac only stuff please.

---

**Edit:** Lots of people have addressed that I should be using linux or mac instead of windows. I addressed that in a couple comments, here's one.

I actually love linux and would actually prefer using it. My home PC is windows only because Mozy doesn't make a linux client. Honestly, that's it. I do admin a fairly large windows network for a living though. Linux fails badly in a highly automated IT environment. There is no suitable alternative for AD/eDir or Zen/SCCM (that I know of at least).

I have a ubuntu VM with seamless mode ready and willing. I even have ubuntu wubi'd as an alternative startup OS. I find myself not using them very often because there isn't anything for what I'm doing that I can't do on windows.

With that said, I'd be a crazy man if my development and production servers weren't running linux. There's no question there.

""The long awaited split 7"" featuring brand new songs by GIANTS and BEWARE OF SAFETY. This is the first new material by either band in over two years... and it was so freakin' worth the wait! One song by each band, both tracks were mastered by Jeff Reeves at Masterdisk NYC. Artwork and screenprinting handled by Three Bears Design's Charlie Wagers and all hand-numbered (red: #401-500, green: #201-400, blue: #1-200). Sooo, as you can see there are three different colors to choose from, as well as a package deal for all three colors. Each vinyl color's jacket corresponds with that color of vinyl (red vinyl = red jacket, etc.) We'll have 100 copies of ""Wild Cherry"" (translucent red), 200 copies of ""Blu-Rasberry"" (translucent blue), and 200 copies of ""Limeade"" (yup, translucent green). Each copy has a hand screenprinted cover with glow in the dark ink! These are printed on thick stock French Paper with the vinyl inserted into a thick black paper inner sleeve. Stick all that into a sturdy polybag and you've got a little bundle of beauty =) Yup, no jivin'. Get you some or become an eBay hater later""""

Throwaway account, obviously. This individual has been posting slanderous statements on twitter about various students under several usernames. Some of this content includes spreading rumors about STDs, homosexuality, among other things.

When the account gets reported for abused and banned, a new one pops up in its place. I'm not sure how, but the new account gets disseminated, and the slandering continues.

The school has been very uncooperative in resolving this. They would appear unwilling to go forth with the time effort and legal perseverance to seek out the individual who is responsible for this.

Many of my friends are upset by this. Several of them have been accused of having sexually transmitted diseases, and some others have been ""forced out of the closet."" To a high-schooler, these can be catastrophic to one's confidence.

What can be done to deal with this?

Edit: just to clarify, I'm not a student at this school, but several of my friends are. They've been asking me to ""investigate"" this and find out who it is, but I'm choosing the more morally objective route.

**UPDATE**: So it would seem this problem is more rampant than originally anticipated. Somebody started out with this idea, and now it's grown like a wildfire in my city, with many copycats now doing this, at least one in every high school. Would going to the media about this incite even MORE interest in this? Something must be done!

**UPDATE 2**: So it would seem that there is now a facebook account created to disseminate this further, going under the name ""Kingston Goss"". How many abuse reports does it usually take for an account to get banned?

285760,"I've looked for this book for over ten years, off and on. I'm almost positive I imagined the whole thing. So, here's what I remember:

The story is possibly (probably) part of a larger series or trilogy. I believe the author's first or last name started with 'M' but that could be totally wrong. The book was probably written late eighties/early nineties and the version I read was paperback. I think there were several storylines going on at once, one in a city-environment and one in the jungle, but that might not be right either.

What I definitely remember: there was a tribe of jungle-dwelling humans who would throw out teenagers/kids of their society for certain reasons. I don't remember the reasons. The leader of a small pack of these cast-off kids is female and her ""second-mate"" is male. I can't remember which one, but either he or she had several of their fingers missing due to interaction with one of the jungle's many poisonous/deadly plants. Most of these kids die but a few survive.

Aaaand, that's it. I've pretty much given up hope on finding this story again, but I figure I'd give it a shot. Thanks for helping!

Also: these might not be from that story but they seem to lump together with it in my head: something about the people in the city are looking for a cure or something and there's some overlying plot going on involving some kind of weather-witchery things and towers.

Having a mob a few blocks below gives you a perfect opportunity to use that useless gravel to suffocate them as long as they are (obviously) within an arms reach. My girlfriend and I had this epiphany when there was a skeleton below her that couldn't be reached with a sword and was too risky to attempt with a bow as the skeleton would easily be able to knock her down off her perch.

It has a giant table that is great for gaming and sits next to a pile of board games that ranges from Agricola to Arkham Horror to Clue to Power Grid to Settlers of Catan to ... well I have too many board games to really go down this list so let's just say that there are a lot of gaming options. I even got my hands on a copy of Dixit in time which looks like a more-than-reasonable 6-person party piece. We have a lot of traditional party games, too.

I was raised to think that when you are hanging out with someone it is really rude to sit there and text someone else especially if it is just the two of you hanging out because that leaves the other person just sitting there hanging.

I will never give my belongings to a mugger, if they want what I have they will have to take it from my cold dead hands, they are hoping that you will be apathetic and weak, so that you wont put up a fight and they can feel like the ""big man"". I have been attempted mugged many times, 2 guns pulled on me, etc. I will still fight for what's right not what's easiest.

290141,"I am an 18 year old high school student as the title states. To begin I want to tell you of the beginning of my life. I was born into a upper class family in Newport Beach, CA. My family is comprised of multiple successful people. As such, the expectations have been placed extremely high for myself, my parent's only child. 
 
In 2002, at the age of 10, I made my first independent investment, buying a middle size house in Costa Mesa, reselling it for a 220 % gain. This was the start of my investment career, until 2007 I traded stocks and accumulated a wealth of 7.2 million dollars. 

In 2007, at the age of 15, I started dating a girl I had been very close with for ~5 years. Later that year, her father, a widow, passed away. My family took her in and raised her, providing for her (not that she needed our money) and made sure she was loved. While this may seem awkward that we still dated, we still are and I plan on marrying her some day.

When I was a child I had 3 goals: 

*  Own a Ferrari. I accomplished this goal earlier this year when I bought a Ferrari Fiorano as a gift to self.

2. Find true love. This one is debateable to most, but the girl I have been with and love is my true soulmate. We have been though each other's hardest times together and we still love each other.

3. Tell my parents I'm not becoming a doctor. This may seem pathetic but this was my birthright. Or birthforce... Not sure what to call it. My family is exceptionally bright and I was no exception. I have maintained a 98% grade average at one of the best private schools in NA. I have determined I want to be a lawyer so that is why I am leaning towards going to Harvard next year.
