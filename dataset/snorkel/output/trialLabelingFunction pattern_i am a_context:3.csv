The problem was all I have is an FL Studio demo.  It was insanely difficult to make the eleven or so drum tracks I did.  You can only work with one tempo and one time signature.  So I tried to finagle it as best as possible.  I only ended up recording five songs using said drums tracks.  And the two I posted have the least amount of timing problems.

My job consists of me adding up numbers and keeping a database of items.  I've never been great at math, but can you give me any tips to dealing with numbers that add up to a total end count?

Edit:  Sorry for being vague,  after all the negative responses, I can see that I should have given you more information.  

Here we go again.....  I get paid to keep an inventory of film.  What has been exposed, what had been short ended(if we load up a 1000ft mag, and only shoot 300ft, then 700ft is a short end), and what hasn't been shot.  We do not keep anything under 200 feet.  So through out the day, I have to keep an updated film inventory and let the boss man know how much we have exposed and what is left on the truck.  Usually we start out with around 25,000 feet of film.  Throughout the day we might shoot anywhere from 5-20,000 feet of film.  I use a spread sheet to keep everything in order, but my spreadsheet doesn't work very well, and has bugs.  With that that, I plan on just doing everything by hand.  

Do you have any recommendations to work on my math skills, as it has been years since I have had to keep track of numbers manually like this.

807,"I typically enjoy the arguments within both the DebateAChristian and DebateAnAtheist subreddits, but I am curious that many of the topics submitted to the DebateAnAtheist subgroup seem to attempt to diminish the veracity of the scientific method.

Examples are:

http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAnAtheist/comments/eabrc/if_a_logically_coherent_worldview_is_more/

http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAnAtheist/comments/e58eq/is_the_scientific_method_the_only_legitimate/

As well as a number of ontological arguments which seem to be little more than semantic games.

It seems as though it should be scientifically possible to prove many of the key points in the bible, so why would it be beneficial to try to tear down science?

The two that spring immediately to mind are the virgin birth and the resurrection.  

Virgin Birth: 

Recently, there was a virgin birth of a litter of snakes:

http://news.bbc.co.uk/earth/hi/earth_news/newsid_9139000/9139971.stm

This virgin birth could easily be determined via serum tests.  In the case of testing a man being born of a virgin woman, we would simply expect YY gender chromosomes.

Resurrection:

Clearly, there are accepted standards (pick a country, it doesn't really matter, they're largely the same) in regards to determining whether a person is dead.  We should be able to determine through current instrumentation whether that person died through as well as whether that same person resurrected.

Both are easily testable.  I can easily understand a reasonable argument saying that science may have been able test these events, but we missed the window of opportunity.  I do get confused though, why there is an attempt to tear down science using philosophical games (as opposed to showing specific portions of the physical world where science failed) when it should be able to easily prove events accepted as fact.  

It also occurs to me that an argument could be made that God exists in a spiritual world as opposed to the physical world in which testable science resides in.  If god was a purely spiritual being, I'd grant this, but clearly god manipulates the physical world (again the examples of the virgin birth, resurrection, and countless others), so god in the spiritual world should be testable in how he affects the physical world. 

tl;dr : Since the key points of christianity should be, in theory, testable and provable using science, then why is there an effort to attempt to discredit science and/or the scientific method?

Thanks for thinking of me ... the worst happened on Kauai... A P-3 Orion radar craft crashed into the mountain ridge at Makaha, on the West side, with 14 people on board. The bodies were stretched out over the ridge (9) and then down in a valley next to it (5). The largest piece was a torso, with entails strewn all over, festooning the Haole Koa... a loud drift of flies buzzing everywhere and about 30 pigs chowing down on the cadaver parts when we arrived at dawn. My most vivid memory was that of a pig with a forearm in its mouth, grunting, standing it's' ground and refusing to back away from a pile of parts... we had to shoot it to start the others moving away.

That incident bothered me for some time afterward... but there were others... people with piles of brains in the road... small children beaten to death by their parents... all kinds of stuff.

Another incident that bothered me was one where I was in charge at the Waikoloa station. We went to an auto accident and I had classic tunnel vision. We were pulling the driver out of the car, severely injured, when one of the guys came up to me and asked... ""What do you want me to do with the body?"" ...THE BODY! What body? A three year old had been thrown from the car and was dead at the scene. That one really shook me up.

In another case, I was driving the ambulance in Waimea and we were going shopping. In front of us was a flat bed vegetable truck, mostly empty, with a old Filipino man sitting on the bed. The truck hit a bump in the road and the Filipino man went up in the air and landed on the road in front of us... striking the back of his head. We very nearly ran him over as we screeched to a skidding stop. When we got out and examined him his eyes were fixed and dilated... dead. I almost was part of that one.

I've posted a couple links and i'm wonder what reddit feels are the causes of this violence and how can it be changed. Are the causes structural (institutional)? Are the causes cultural? Are they inherently genetic? Is violence/war something that can be changed or will it inevitably destroy the human race? And how does media contribute to these arguments and perpetuate violence or help alleviate it?

Other questions are those based on equality. Do all people have an equal inherent right to livelihood? If so why is poverty tolerated and what institutions can be changed to combat it?

1740,"Most Christians take for granted the idea that they have a soul and free will, but if you think seriously about it, both are unlikely to exist from a scientific perspective. How do you know you have an immaterial soul? No one has ever observed or measured one. Where is it inside the body? If science and empiricism cannot detect it, how can you be sure it exists? 

Without an immaterial soul, how can we possibly have free will? If our thoughts and actions are determined by our brains and our brains are comprised solely of neurons and electrochemical reactions, then our actions are governed entirely by the deterministic laws of physics at a fundamental level, i.e. no free will. Another less materialistic argument against free will is the following: you do what you do because of the way you are. But you can't be ultimately responsible for the way you are because the way you are is entirely the result of your genetic inheritance and previous experience. Therefore, you can't be ultimately responsible for what you do; no free will.

Now I know it's much easier to simply say we have a soul and free will because the Bible says so, but I'm afraid that's just not a good enough response. Science and logic are not in your favor.

I've had girlfriends but obviously haven't gotten far.  I didn't start dating anyone until I was 20 and just have never had much of a sex drive I guess.  I've finished a few times from mastrubating but really don't expect to for the most part.  I have no idea how to make it happen.  I think about girls that get me horny and start going.  And just never arrive.  It's easy for what seems to be everyone else and I'm too embarrassed to bring it up to anyone who knows me.

I have a girlfriend now and we've been together for a year and a half.  We can only fool around at my house when it's empty because she doesn't want to anywhere that's not in one of our places and hers is always occupied.  We've given each other oral and I have no problem making her finish.  I get a hard-on very easily around her and I know how to stimulate her.  No matter what she does though, I can't ever finish.  I've had to fake it numerous times and feel righteously shitty and pathetic about it.  She knows I have a problem but says that it's worked fine with her exes so it's i my head.  I've forgotten what the sensation feels like.

I am a single mother and can't afford the bill because I'm told that according to the paperwork from the boss, I make too much money to qualify. This doesn't make sense to me because I was on financial aid before when I had a better-paying job. I think that they're lying about my income for either tax or wage-law purposes and when I did some research tonight to figure this out, I found out that when they trained me to do my financial paperwork, they actually taught me to handle it illegally. I don't want to get in trouble for tax fraud, which they're asking me to do, but if I don't report that they're lying about my income then I can't afford my bills for the next two months and my baby and I will get evicted. If I turn them in I can't get in trouble can I? I've been working there for two months and just found out about all of this.

TLDL: I've been suspecting that my employer has been lying in government documents about my income. Suspicions confirmed tonight. I also found out tonight that they've been asking me to commit tax fraud and I have no idea how to figure my income of the last two months because they haven't tracked my actual income (tips) for me and they have told me all along that I didn't need to.

Or an emotionally abusive relationship where your SO constantly degrades you. What goes through your head?

I think this is one of the LEAST misogynic places on the web.  Outside of sarcasm and jokes, I really don't think I've ever seen a legitimately misogynic comment here get upvoted.  People who get easily offended by jokes (misogynist or otherwise) shouldn't be on the internet in the first place.

The internet can be awful, and it can be awesome.  It can be awful in r/politics and r/askreddit because people often go there to vent.  However, if you're looking for a community sharing a particular interest, the subreddits here can be the best place on the entire web.  We have some of the friendliest most helpful mavens out there, and that shouldn't be overlooked just because of a few losers.

* Linear Algebra
* Differential Equations

I think there's something brewing between us for various reasons, such as him resting his hand on my knee when we talk to each other.  At any rates, I obviously like him.

As a rule, I'm usually studying.  I usually have papers to write and problems to solve and the time I spend with my friends I consider precious and spare.  However, when this guy and I are talking to each other, neither of us can really figure out how to shut up and move on. For instance, I visited him the other day for a quick question (that still had to be dealt with in person).  We got off topic, eventually starting a teasing/physical fight.  It was already late into the night (as in early morning), and I was sort of making motions to leave, when he suggests watching a movie or playing online video games.  His computer was messing up, so we ended up just talking a bit longer before I left.  I guess you could call that leaving, but he kept talking to me even after I closed his door, and I was not making a rush to depart either.

These sort of things like to happen.  I then chastise myself and try to make up for lost time.  On the other hand, I'm always glad these stupid things happen.  I've had more than one person wake me up from a smiling reverie.  I'm sure that I have spent more time with him than the time I have spent with several other friends put together, including my roommate.

Issues:

1. He dated one of our closest mutual friends a couple of years ago.  I've spoken to her about it and she's completely over him and they've been friends ever since.  She's even given me her blessing.  A couple of months ago, he was rambling about things (he had some alcohol in his system) and mentioned that he regretted breaking up with her.

2. If we're studying together or something and a girl walks by, he lets me know what her favorable features are.  He sometimes has many superficial crushes, but recently he told a friend of ours (in my presence) that he had no ""real"" crushes at the moment.

3. He often tells me little ways to improve my appearance in order to attract more guys.

4. Most importantly, he talks about what he likes about girls, and his fantasies rarely describe me.  I'm too short and my eyes are not quite prominent enough.

http://blog.reddit.com/2009/08/reddits-fatastic-voyage-reddit.html

I think *that* idea is **amazing.** Let me throw in my two cents, or as we germans say ""Lass mich mal mein Senf dazu geben""

About four years ago when I was still playing World of warcraft we organised a guild meeting for our super amazing ""Suicide Kings"" guild.

*Anyway* We organised a guild meeting where we had about 20 guys and girls fly in from all over the world and they stayed at my apartment in Germany for a weekend. It was so much fun being around these people in real life. Being around such like-minded individuals. You could tell some of them were really socially awkward but as soon as they were around other people that were like them they flowered and were completely fine.

We did all kinds of stuff and I took them out to show them some cool things in my city.

This sort of thing is a lot of fun. And I don't mean hanging around in one ""convention centre"", I mean a good group of people watching maybe a cult movie and going to oktoberfest together. Or having a huge BBQ etc.

Maybe an international flash mob event?

Or taking a train to Finland and seeing wtf is going on over there.

Or meeting in Australia to see what it's like standing upside down.

I'm sure it was an awesome feeling being at the rally as well. Knowing you are surrounded by other Redditors.

I would really love to support an international get together of reddit users. 

Would other reddit user be interested in organising something like this?

Height- 6'3

My chest went from a 36 to 40
Biceps- 14-15
Quads-21-23
Waist is like the same

In a nutshell, I did bodyweight stuff mostly, and started lifting recently (I always lifted legs though).  I play a lot of basketball.  I do sprints, and only do long cardio when i feel my endurance is lacking.

For lifting I usually do 10 8 6 4, for reps, with drop sets on the last 2 sets.

Diet- Lotta protein and vegetables, nuts, and fruit.  I try and limit grains but I'm arab so i still eat a lot of pita bread (whole grain though).  I also love cereal, but i only eat that after workouts, and not daily.

When people offer ideas to improve your life, the lives of others and find more happiness, ignore the message and pick apart the details.

When people offer advice to fix your problems, come up with ""reasons"" why you can't  do whatever they said. Find a reason why it won't work. Make excuses, procrastinate, bitch, and seek pity. 

Make no effort to research solutions to your problems. Instead, bitch to whoever will listen. Hell, bitch to those who won't, after all your life sucks and everyone should know, right?

Whenever you hang out with friends, make sure conversations are focused on your problems. Make snarky comments a lot and when anything positive is said, roll your eyes and say ""Pfft, yeah right"". Always find a negative aspect to whatever anyone says.

Complain and whine incessantly. When the line is too long at the market, when your order at the restaurant isn't perfect, when things don't go as you expect or are in any way even slightly inconvenient, make a fuss and bitch about the situation. For added measure, stamp your feet and pout. If anyone tries to reason with you, just be irrational and blame everything on them.

Take no personal responsibility for anything. Nothing is your fault and probably not your responsibility, either. You are a vicitm, and it's not your fault that things just don't work out for you. 

When political issues arise, don't try to think of solutions. Rather, blame everything on whatever party you don't belong to. Your party is always right and theirs is always wrong. Never admit any wrongdoing from anyone who agrees with you and never admit anything good about whoever disagrees.

Go to various social sites and find things wrong with what people post. Try to make them feel inferior and stupid. Ignore any good points they make and if you have nothing factual to go on, pick apart their grammar or just insult them somehow. Ridicule anyone you disagree with even slightly. Dehumanize them and pat yourself on the back for being so clever.

Never admit you're wrong about anything. After all, yourd rather be ""right"" than factual, right? As long as it looks like you're ""winning"" you're doing the right thing.

If you have nothing to bitch about, find something. Invent something if you must. 

Under no circumstances should you ever lift a finger to help anyone else or even yourself. It's all about you.

9217,"I collected old video game cartridges, consoles, PC games and other paraphernalia for a number of years. My interest in it eventually waned, and earlier this year I eventually decided to sell off what I had. I knew some friends had used ebay to sell this sort of stuff so I decided to give it a go. I had quite a bit of this stuff so I listed it in small batches, 50-60 or so auctions a week, for about four months until it was all (mostly) sold.

I had what I thought was a fairly straightforward policy in every auction. I made a single photograph of every item (ebay charges you for extra photos) and made an attempt to list any other defects I didn't think were obvious from the photograph. I stated that the buyer would receive what was in the photograph and nothing more. I said that the item was sold AS-IS (meaning that a buyer agrees they can't return it if they don't like it, NO refunds, and the ""no returns"" option was chosen for every auction). I also tried my best to keep shipping costs down as much as I could by offering the cheaper shipping options (first class or media mail) when I could, and combining shipping when people bought more than one thing from a batch. 

I would say that out of 95% of all transactions, things went really smooth. The buyers were satisfied and I got paid. 2% of the time, people didn't pay, but you have to wait before you can file a case to get your ""end item fees"" back. 1% of the time people asked for refunds for what I thought were legitimate reasons (usually I made a mistake on the auction page) and I gave them their money back. The other 2% of the time I dealt with a lot of childish, petulant morons, and I took it in the ass from ebay, every time. 

Ebay forces you to list a shipping cost BEFORE the auction goes live, and in order to combine shipping (to keep costs LOW for buyers of multiple things) I couldn't box anything up until the current batch was done. This made it impossible to know what the real shipping cost would be, so I had to use my scale and make a guess at what the cost of shipping single items would be. I got better at at my estimates towards the end but sometimes the true shipping cost would be higher. Some buyers refused to pay the difference, and ebay sided with them **every time** and I was forced to pay the difference. The irony of this is that I eventually started listing slightly INFLATED estimates so that this would never happen, and then send buyers invoices that reflected a LOWER shipping cost. The result? Most buyers ended up paying the inflated shipping costs before I even had a chance to send them their invoices. 

Sometimes buyers were just unhappy with what they bought. Buyers remorse most likely. Usually they claimed the item was significantly different than what was pictured (it wasn't) or that it had damage not shown (it didn't). Sometimes USPS smashed their box (not my problem or my fault). I apologized for their unhappiness but reminded them of the AS-IS statement in every auction. Usually they would demand a refund (which I would refuse), and they would file a case with ebay. It doesn't matter what my auction says, one particular rude customer says, **ebay's policy overrides yours and I'll get my money back**. Ebay took my money from me and gave it to them **every time**. It didn't seen to matter what I wrote down as an explanation. My blood pressure started to rise.

Then there were the buyers that you simply couldn't satisfy. They demanded things that no reasonable person would (or could) accommodate. For most of these I successfully ""canceled"" the transaction but I had to relist. I had one buyer who AFTER the auction ended demanded that I box the item in such a way that no possible damage would come to it (simply not possible in reality) and that I was to **guarantee** the item would arrive in the condition pictured. I calmly told them I would be glad to double (or triple) box the item and ship insured but they would have to pay extra for it. They refused. I canceled the transaction and they gave me negative feedback (I drank myself to sleep that night).

The straw that broke the camels back was with the guy that bought a poster (ended up selling for about $50). I put it in a tube and sent it to him media mail (to keep costs low, otherwise people bitch about high shipping costs). He didn't buy insurance. A month goes by and he sends a message saying it's not there. I tell him it's out of my hands and to talk to the post office. Another week and he sends another message asking what his options are. I again tell him it's out of my hands, talk to the post office. He open a case, I explain that it was sent and he didn't buy insurance, ebay closes the case five minutes later (in his favor), takes the money from me and gives it to him. I looked at my computer screen stunned for a while in amazement before the anger (and the pain in my anus) set in. I ended up writing the guy telling him I thought it was bullshit and he agreed and we ended up splitting the refund 50/50.

tl;dr People that buy from you on ebay can get their money back for any reason at all, and you have no recourse

Why don't we start our own? Closest thing to what I am thinking is http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_American_Independent_Party but even so it doesn't seem to have done much. I am talking about grass roots, tech savvy, empirical data using, non-denomination based, common-sense-ism of a party.

Huge transparency, community based, web coordinated collaboration and deliberation on issues and topics leading to appointed members and candidates. Not fettered by rich assholes that are out of touch and in it for their own interests. 

I'm just an average dude tired of the shit. Wikileaks has it right for showing the country the reality they've sold themselves to and I want to live in a world where we can own up to the shit we actually do instead of hiding behind and obfuscating our responsibilities as citizens and subsequently as a nation.

I am 29, live in Los Angeles. I've been unemployed for over a year, getting work here and there but not nearly enough. My rent is due today and I have zero money. I don't know where else to turn. I have roommates and don't want to burden them or drag them down with my non-payment.

I own a small business: I self-published a deck of playing card for the game of Mafia (the party game). I make a little money off this each month, usually very little. Instead of just asking for a handout, would you consider buying a deck of Mafia cards from me? If I can get roughly 50 orders, I can pay my rent. I will also send you two decks for the price of one. It's a really fun and well-made game. Please understand this is not a ploy to market my game, this is a sincere call for help. 

I'd be super appreciative if you'd consider doing this for me. Please type in ""Reddit"" in the ""Add coment to seller"" section while purchasing and I'll ship an extra deck to you.

Is there any sort of library for dealing with data like this, and accessing it in a user-friendly way.

Ideal usage would be something like:

db = TimeData()
db.set_val('2010-12-01 12:00','temp',34)

 I do have 'experience' with women. longest relationship was 5 years. 

ask away. oh and i'd like to add that im not proud of feeling this way.

10390,"I know I haven't always been very out-going, but when I got to college, I really blossomed. I started to talk to people, joke around, go to mixers, etc. I know a lot of people, but it seems like I'm rather...forgettable. ""Out of sight, out of mind"" applies perfectly to me. No one ever calls me to do anything or even to talk. I rarely receive any kind of communication that is not a response to something I said. Even when I'm with people, I'm easily ignored or talked over. The people that say we're ""such good friends"" don't talk to me for weeks (sometimes months) on end. Every social thing I do comes from me having to instigate it--whether it's organizing a dinner or just talking to people.

I know that it's not quantity but quality that counts, but I feel like you have to hang out a lot to grow closer, right? I know that waiting for attention is stupid, so I started inviting myself to everything. I went 90% of the way in all my friendships all the time, but my friends never changed. So I just stopped trying...even now, I don't really get out much, and people really haven't noticed.  

This doesn't bother me the majority of the time, but every few months it sinks back in and I get depressed for a few days. My birthday was last week, and no one said anything at all. I'm not sad that everyone didn't, just that the few people I'm kind of closer to didn't. That hit me hard. It makes me want to figure out what I did wrong...I've been told by someone that I'm ""unapproachable,"" whatever that means.

I do know a lot of people and I have a lot of casual acquaintances. I guess it's just that deep down, I know I don't have anyone to share my secrets with, cry on, have a movie marathon with, etc.

Finally, my questions: am I really that forgettable? Am I just not trying hard enough? Or are people just lame?

tl;dr : I'm pretty much ignored, people don't remember I'm alive if I'm not around. Is this my fault?

10690,"So I've had varying success with making gravy over the past few years.  I like to try to make gravy after sauteing chicken, pan frying beef, or cooking a steak by saute/oven roast.  

What I'd like to know is -- how much of what ingredients do people like to use?  I used to do something like this:  deglaze with broth or wine, let reduce, add a slurry of stock mixed with a thickener and cook until thickened.  There were a number of problems.  I usually have the pan very hot when adding the deglazing agent, and I have found it almost immediately evaporates/thickens/reduces.  Perhaps I should lower the heat here, or add more deglazing agent?  The problem I have found with that is, depending on what is used to deglaze, that taste can overpower the gravy (particularly balsamic vinegar).  I haven't used wine that often, but I am thinking that it works the best.

The next problem is that adding a slurry of stock and some thickener (corn starch, flour, or arrowroot are what I've normally tried), in my opinion, tends to mess up the flavor.  It's almost like you can taste the blandness of flour, arrowroot seems to impart a very weird sweet taste, and corn starch is just meh.  

By varying the amounts of deglazing agent, stock, and thickener I have come up with gravies that are better or worse, but few I would call outstanding (or nearly as good as a pan gravy I've made from pan drippings -- like from a turkey).  What I've started doing is skipping the thickener, and just deglazing and then adding a bit of stock and reducing.  However to get to the right consistency it seems that I need to reduce it A LOT, and only get a tiny bit of gravy for my effort.

12385,"I am a freshman in college. About three months ago I got a job working at Jimmy Johns. We close at 4am and I work the night shift. So one day I decide after closing to go to the library to get some work done. While I'm there I see this cute girl from my English class working at the front desk of the commons. Seeing a way in, I go up to her and start talking about a recent assignment in class. I stay there until her shift ended at 8am
I start making this a bit of a habit, stopping by after work and bringing her some of the extra bread we made at work. This goes on for about a month. Then I start bringing her an employee-priced sandwich I made myself (I told her we got them for free). Keep in mind this whole time I never ask her out on a date, never even hint at anything about wanting a relationship (which of course I did). I also found out that she was dating someone and that she really liked him.

This is where it gets interesting, I go home during Thanksgiving break and tell my old high school friends about her. They convince me to say something to her and even give me a great idea for how to express my love for her. So, one night after work, I make her a sandwich and wrap it up in a bag. Then I drive down to the 24 hour Walmart and buy a fresh-cut pink rose (at least I think it was a rose...might have just been a flower). I put the rose in the bag and stapled the bag shut. Then I went down the to the library and gave her the bag and said something about how I needed to get some sleep and left.

The next day I received a call from her. She had finally gotten around to eating the sandwich (12 hours later?) and noticed the flower. She called to let me know that she was in a serious relationship and that while she appreciated the gift, nothing could happen between us. She was cordial about it and I completely understand her reaction.

Here goes:

RHETORICAL QUESTIONS

Is war necessary at times? 

If yes, is it only acceptable when bringing freedom to people who would otherwise not have freedom? At what point is the death of innocent people an acceptable loss in the quest to defeat an evil power? Is the loss of innocent lives in war accepted without any kind of moral penalty?  Do we grant soldiers and trained killers permission to carry out these terrible acts, as long as we don't get our hands dirty?

Assuming you've followed my train of thought thus far:

We hate war. We say it is terrible and cruel and barbaric, yet we admit that at times in human history, it has only been through brute force, grand spectacle and loss of innocent lives that true positive change has occurred. The ""evil"" (ignoring a segue into subjective definition of evil) will always try to conquer with brute force; the ""good"", no matter how much contempt some may hold for war, must at times fight fire with fire, or the world would be a world of slavery.

We typically rally against losing our civil liberties in favor of security. We want security, but the preservation of liberty is typically held in highest esteem.

Is it hypocritical to fiercely oppose any loss of privacy or liberty in exchange for security, while at the same time we condone the willful taking of others' life and liberty in exchange for securing freedom? How do rationalize this? Do we have a right to do this? Does the noble goal justify the hypocrisy?

What was your experience like?  My first time me and my friend picked up a bag of K2 blue at a smoke shop.  3 grams for 15 bucks, why not?  The K2 got me high sometimes, other times not so much...  The trouble started after that bag ran out.  We picked up a bag of something called Space Cadet.  More expensive, but stronger.  We smoked a blunt with 4 heads of that stuff, and it was a great night!  The next day me and my friend decided to kill the bag which was about half of what we started with.  That was **the worst** experience I've ever had.  As we started to walk out of the forest the high got more intense.  My vision started to strobe.  My thoughts sounded like how your voice sounds when you speak through a fan.  It was almost like I lost control of my thoughts.  This was not a fun trip at all.

13781,"     where to even begin... I don't even know why I'm posting this, maybe its because I'm desperately trying to find a reason to keep pushing along day after day, maybe I'm really just crying for help, maybe I just want someone to validate me now as I'm trying so hard to grasp at any thread as the tapestry of my life unravels.       
     Lately I've been thinking more and more about ending it. At first it was just fleeting thoughts of how I would do it, what method would be quickest and easiest. Then I started reading forum posts about suicide, half looking for ideas on how, half looking for reasons not to. Sadly enough, as I read strangers telling other strangers text book reasons for why they shouldn't kill themselves I came to realize that those reasons did not apply to me. 
     Most people say you shouldn't kill yourself because of how your family would feel, how selfish it is to end it and make them suffer, but that's just it, i want to die because of my family, i want to make them suffer as they have made me suffer for so long. I've hated them for as long as I can remember. My sister has serious mental issues, her whole life she has been a hypochondriac, her whole life my mother has coddled her and endorsed this behavior. At some point it evolved into shameless greed, she feels like she deserves the world because she's sick, even tho she is the one making herself sick. She's pushed my family to the brink of bankrupcy so she can live like a queen, a perfect house, with a perfect dog, a brand new car she can't afford, knowing my family will break themselves to provide for her, and yet its not enough. She is constantly miserable, always suffering from violent mood swings, she makes everyone around her miserable. One second she will befriend someone, then the next shun them, all the while the same people come to me to unload their stress from the situation. Every day someone tells me how horrible my family is, how horribly they are treated by them, this has been going on for 13 years. 
     My mother is her only friend, and the irony in this is that my sister hates my mother with a passion, whenever my mother isn't there to listen, my sister complains constantly how horrible she is, despite the house, car, and dog my mother has provided for her, despite the taxing costs of providing this all to her. she is so incredibly selfish, she can never see beyond her immediate wants, she has no empathy, she doesn't even care about her own mother.
      I used to care about my mother, but somewhere along the line, i stopped caring when it became apparent that i will always live in my sister's shadow. It will always be expected of me to sacrifice so my sister can have more. When i realized my sister was the favored child, and that I was just a scapegoat to take blame for every fight, I stopped caring about my mother. I stopped caring about my 'family'. My sister's prevalence in our family is so blatant it disgusts me, every couple months my mother and sister go on vacation, they never take me, never even ask, but even more insulting is that they never tell me they are going until one of them hands me a piece of paper outlining my schedual for taking care of her dog while they are away, or for taking care of the business, they never ask ""can you take care of my dog?"" or ""is it cool if you come in every morning this week while we're away?"" its simply expected that I will do it. This is but one example of how my family treats me, consider it the metaphorical 'tip of the iceberg', my discontent towards them runs far deeper than this, this behavior is prevalent now only because it happened again recently.
     I know most people will tell me to simple cut ties and leave, live my own life, and believe me, I've debated doing so, but the prospects are weak. I am a high school drop out. I do not have much potential for supporting myself if it weren't for the fact that my family owns a business. I am bound to this business, as I would surely fail without them. Why did I drop out of high school, you ask? when I was 16 I made enemies with a drug dealer in my school, his parents were lawyers. After numerous fights and hostile encounters we ended up having a parent teacher conference, his parents threatened to sue the school, and I was told I would be expelled, so I left before they had the chance. Less than 2 years later, the drug dealer I had conflicts with threw himself in front of a train and ended his life. 
    So where does that leave me? I have to work with my family, because I am undereducated and can not find proper work without them. I am paid less than my sister, despite the fact that I work at least 15 hours a week more than her, and when she's 'sick' I work even more, but it has been explained to me that she 'needs' the salary so she can pay her bills. Ironic, I have been as fiscally responsible as possible with my meager salary my whole life, i carry no credit card debt, i find a way to pay my bills in full and on time every month, but lately its been increasingly difficult to make ends meet, and yet she spends well beyond her means. She 'needs' to be paid more than me because she has overwhelming credit card debt, and loans she can't pay. So I work more, earn less, and reap no rewards except being left out of every vacation they take, get treated like shit every time they fight, deal with every discontent customer because they can't 'handle the stress anymore', play counselor to every employee that's about to quit because my sister treated them like sub-human filth. 
     I can't take it anymore, I don't see a light at the end of the tunnel any more, I can't even dream of a way out. My mind is plagued by dark thoughts now, I feel like I am living in a shadow, or rather that I am simply a shadow, an image cast on the ground beside them, it is expected that I will unconditionally follow them, and act as they decree.  I hate myself more everyday for allowing it to continue, but every time i try to assert myself and my discontent for the situation or the way my sister acts, I am shunned by my mother, told I am making her life harder by fighting with my sister, but I simply can not tolerate her any more.
    This is my life, this is every moment of my being, this is all I have. My friends tell me I am smart enough to leave and find a job elsewhere, but every time I try I fail miserably because I never received a piece of paper from a university confirming my ability to perform at a given task. I want to go to school, but I am paid so little by my family I can't afford to, and even if i were approved for financial aid, I highly doubt my ability to cling to life long enough to obtain a degree, I couldn't see myself pushing thru the stress of school while working with my family, as I am already to the point of seriously considering suicide. 
    Am I insane? Am I the one acting irrationally? Is this the way of life, should it be expected of me to cater to them in this way? Is this how 'normal' families act? Why do they fail to see how miserable I am? Why don't they care? I try so hard to do good by our business but I've never been given anything as simple as a 'thank you' I never go anywhere or do anything because my whole life revolves around them and the business. I want to live my own life, I want to make my own path, I want so desperately to garner respect from my peers, but every day I am simply pitied by them because they can see my situation as I do, but yet my family fails to see. I am nothing to them, I wonder if they will even second guess themselves when I'm gone. Will they realize the error of their ways when I leave? Will they realize how they treated me for so long when its over? Or will they dismiss me as being mentally ill and continue their ridiculous lives? 
     As I write this I am becoming increasingly relieved, with every minute I spend away from them I feel slightly more content with life, almost like I can see a future ahead, but I know tomorrow I will be bogged back down into this darkness, I know tomorrow the same ridiculous events will play out and I will feel the same again, this happens every day, this cycle is the norm to me, every day I fear going to work and dealing with them, because every day there is some drama. Every day I am made to feel like shit, every day I am walked on by them, and every day when its over, I go home, and the longer I go with out seeing or talking to them, the happier I become. But every night when i go to sleep, I fear what the next day will bring, I'm so tired of it.
     To sum it up in a TL;DR fashion, i feel trapped, enslaved by a family that shuns me. I'm constantly treated as a scapegoat, I can't find a way out, and I fail to make them understand my unhappiness. I am nothing, just a tool for them to operate their failing business, and clean up after them. Its been this way for so long, I used to think I was strong, I used to think I could be the bigger person and let it all roll off my back, but a decade later, I've been worn down, my pride is broken, I have nothing, I am nothing.

14355,"I got sick over Thanksgiving, which is making it hard to keep up training like I want to.  I am so low on patience!

I dozed off under the influence of Nyquil last night before putting the 13* week old puppy in her bathroom for the night... This morning at around 3am she peed on my bed and me. I woke up to wetness through all 3 blankets, stripped off the sheets, sopped up the mess in a fuzzy daze and fell back to sleep on the bare mattress, super disappointed in her - I thought she at least knew better than to pee in the bed. 

Then today during one of the many, many reluctant potty breaks outside with her, my older dog stole and subsequently barfed up 1/4 bag of chocolate chips in several locations on the carpet.  Luckily after puking it out he seems to be feeling better... but while cleaning that I managed to make it much worse, slinging it across my freshly-showered-and-changed self and more of the carpet.  I got it on my pants, on both my shirt and my sweatshirt and in my hair even! 

Then I knocked over a mug in the kitchen, breaking it, while I was rinsing out the rag.  After sweeping that up I finally changed into clean clothes and then immediately got snot on my shirt. I was such a mess, scrubbing chocolate vomit, sobbing, with a runny nose; and all the while the dogs are screaming from their crate/bathroom for me to let them out, as they'd been cooped up nearly all day.  The puppy has been shut up all day because I've been sleeping and otherwise I have to watch her constantly and run outside with her every 5 minutes when she rings her bell for no reason. Every time she drinks water I start to resent her, thinking she is doing it just so she can pee all over everything and make me drop everything to take her out.  She drinks so much water!  And when they are out and free to play she is just terrorizing the older dog, stealing anything he is chewing on and being a pest in general.

I don't think the world was ready for such transparency.  They latched onto Assange as the figure head, and began using all their efforts to bring him down, or (as many mainstream politicians have stated) to murder him. So I was thinking, what if the leaks weren't connected to any person, or even any website. But instead were massive dumps into usenet, and torrented via file sharing programs.  

We could lose the entire organisational aspect of wikileaks. And the leaks would be less accurate. And these negative aspects shouldn't be ignored. However, there is already a massive clandestine system in place to disseminate information throughout the globe very quickly. It could be done anonymously, and it would still inevitably make it to the front pages of the mainstream media if the documents were irrefutable (ie. the leaked video of the apache helicopter mowing down civilians)

Imagine how different the coverage would be without Assange being cast as the evil villain. I just watched a 5 minute piece on CNN about how different news anchors mispronounce Assange's name. We shouldn't expect them to report these issues in an in depth manner. They want soundbites and narrative arcs about individuals.

Basically you buy a minimum of 8 gallons, immediately show your receipt to the cashier/attendant &amp; he/she will give you a BP Loyalty card that has a number on it. You then enter the number on the website www.thankyoudays.com. Do this five times (get 5 cards) and BP will send you a $10 reward card in 4-6 weeks. 

There is a limit of 3 reward cards per household....so the max each household should be able to get is $30 in reward cards.

Note: I am not sure exactly WHAT you can do with a ten dollar ""reward card"", but I assume you can at LEAST buy gas with it. Maybe it is a simple gift card you can use anywhere.... I dont know.

I mean my dad was certainly “unlucky”. My father was born with no arms or legs in one of the most mountainous states in the country, with the poorest transportation system. He was a 16th generation carnie, and in addition his father started his own interpretive dance studio and hot dog parlor to produce things like interpretive dancers, hot dogs and hot dogs made from interpretive dancers. Then one day the Union demanded that he stop making his special hot dogs and then shut the place down...

“You bastards!” He yelled as he looked away with his bad eye and stared them boys down with his good eye. Grandpappy would have defeated those Union boys had it not been for the poorly placed industrial cotton candy machine right behind him. To this day folks talk about how he was back flipping away from a group of Union soldiers and just never noticed and jumped into that vat of cotton candy. Though some folk like to think that grandpappy just dern gave up on living that day when his dance studio/hot dog factory was shut down. My father's mother died shortly there after, she said “If'n my brother ain't here by my side I reckon there ain't no reason to go on livin'” Then she too followed my grandpappy into the fluffy pink beyond. Now some people will tell you that those wasn't no Union boys and instead were health inspectors, well that may be true; but I ain't gonna hear no talk about. Now some people may tell you that my grandpappy called his puppy mill an interpretive dance studio, but he did have a hot dog factory! 

So my father was there with no arms or legs. He had to travel to school up hill both ways, and he ain't got no legs. So my father invented a way to travel to school, and that is how a popular dance called the worm was invented. In fact it was Teddy Roosevelt who was traveling through town that day and noticed my father making his daily trek to school, and then with a wink and laugh announced that he was gonna patent the dance. Oh my father tried to get it back from President Roosevelt, and he did managed to chase him for a quarter mile; but Teddy's greater mobility combined with that dang gravel road proved to be my father's undoing. So defeated by President Roosevelt my father made it to school, where he had to shovel coal all day long. This was on account that the only school that would admit my father was a school devoted completely to the study of shoveling coal which weren't easy on my father on account of the no arms or legs.  

Upon graduation from Coal Men's Academy, my father wrote something of 3,000 letters to businessmen asking them to help pay for his education. This was hard for my father on account of his not having any hands, and suffering from that thar illiteracy. You know what happened to my father? Do you wanna know? All 3,000 of those businessmen showed up and beat my father with Nerf bats. For 5 days they all took turns beating my father with Nerf bats...they took vacation time for this. After the five days was ended each of those businessmen tossed my father a nickle which he went down to the corner store with. There he bought seven loaves of bread, 18 gallons of milk, 50 pounds of sugar and 19 dozen eggs. He then used those to create a rather drastic pastry treat, and that is how cup cakes were invented. The remaining money my father used to buy the corner store, and then finance his first three college degrees; which was amazing on account of the no arms and legs and the fact that my father was completely illiterate! All while working at the corner store as an unpaid intern putting in 185 hours a week on account of inventing a time distortion field that allowed him to work, sleep and study more hours than actually existed in a standard Earth week. That was was over 95 years ago, and my father has since earned 17 masters all while putting insurance, clothes and etc on our table...
I wasn't even born with a body, but that ain't stop me from earning some of that thar book learning. Earning me a Ph.d in Nuclear Physics, which is amazing on account of being a disembodied spirit who suffers from the illiteracy.

Just because you are ""unlucky"" doesn't mean that your life has to suck long term. All it means is you have to work harder to get where you want. Suck it up, realize that ""shit sucking"" is a temporary condition as long as you are willing to work hard enough to pull yourself out, and stop feeling sorry for yourselves.

18054,"First off, I'm not here to tell you to ditch the cheetos and hit the gym.  Now that's out of the way, down to business.

There are a billion and one different fad diets and eat this, not that things out there.  Don't study up on them, don't read more about how to lose weight, just fucking stop.  You are wasting your time if you are trying to lose more than about 30 pounds.  You are investigating methods which will start you on a hopeless cycle of trying to adhere to some new science ""standard"" that tells you how to lose weight EVEN FASTER.

If one were to actually believe all the articles read about the percentage weight loss incurred if you eat only certain foods, and NOT THAT FOOD THERE, we could theoretically (based on their research) lose 200 pounds instantly.  By eating just meat.  Or just vegetables.  Or only whole grains.  Or no sugar.  Or lower carbs with some sugar.  And so on.

These are not good diet tips!  If you are trying to lose 5 to 10 pounds, MAYBE trying some of these things will help you, because you are very close to your expected minimum weight.  Good luck with that.

If you are 30+ pounds, STOP RIGHT NOW.  Do not try to increase your weight loss speed by going on these ridiculous fad diets.  Drop it by doing the only SURE FIRE way of losing weight, calorie deficit.

I am not out to earn money, but I am going to give you the easiest diet plan of your entire life: induce a calorie deficit through any means necessary.

  * Weigh yourself at the beginning of the week, because you have to start somewhere
  * Eat normally, try not to pig out during the week, but keep your intake about the same every day
  * Weigh yourself for 7 days in a row, and TRACK YOUR CALORIES (if you're trying to lose more than 30 pounds, you clearly NEED to do this)

During this period, I don't care if you eat 5 guys and fries every day, just track the damn calories.  If your weight stayed the same, awesome, it'll be easier to go on, if not, you have some basic math ahead of you, and here is where the calorie tracking comes in.

  * If you didn't lose any weight day to day, great, you are eating your MAINTENANCE calories, that means the exact number of calories needed to stay at your weight
  * If you lost weight, you are already in a deficit, super!
  * If you GAINED weight, you need to SUBTRACT 500 calories for every pound you gained to get your MAINTENANCE weight
  * If you ate 5000 calories one day, and 1000 the next, you didn't follow the program, start over.
  * If you ate 2000 calories one day and 3000 calories the next, you didn't follow the program, start over.
  * If you fudged your results, or cheated and didn't add the calories, you didn't follow the program, start over.
  * If your maintenance calories turns out to be 3000+ or more calories, you are either an athlete or need to see a doctor.  I'm pretty sure you know which one you are.

Now that everyone has their maintenance weight, it's time to /r/loseit.  This second week, you need to maintain a calorie deficit of 500 calories under your maintenance weight.  Do this every single day.  There are multiple ways to do this, here are a few:

  * Eat less, this one is probably the easiest, cutting 500 calories is probably a lot easier than you'd think
  * Work out, there are many websites that can estimate lost calories for excercises, use them and don't look for the one that tells you the highest calorie loss, just be honest
  * Follow an aerobic video like P90x, 30 day shred, Insanity or so on.  These probably do NOT burn as many calories as you think, for example, 30 day shred only burns 120-200 calories depending on the level and how much you actually participate

Have you induced a 500 calorie deficit?  Did you fudge your results?  If so, get thee back to step one.  If not, do this for the week.  Weigh yourself every day.

At the end of the week did you weigh less?  I am SHOCKED, you DO?  Look at that, you ate whatever foods you wanted to and LOST WEIGHT.  Many fad diets, plans and food sellers try to get you to buy their cardboard hats and tell you that you can eat as many as you want (and dress up their fancy hats as ""lasagna"" or ""pie"", when we really know they still taste like hats).  This is because they take out almost everything that makes that food tasty and replace it with things you cannot digest, similar to diet soda.  That makes it lower calorie, which is their whole plan to begin with, making you eat fewer calories.

What they don't want you to know is, you can do this on your own!

If you did NOT lose weight, you cheated and did not maintain a calorie deficit every day.  You thought you could induce a cheating day.  You cannot.  This is your weight loss, not weight maintenance, goal.  ""But I have a hard time losing weight!""  BUULLLLL.  Again, this is for people who are losing more than 30 pounds.  If you REALLY HONESTLY followed the program and didn't eat that medium sized pizza at midnight, congratulations, you are in the less than 10% of the population that cannot lose weight on a normal method.  But you already knew this and saw your doctor because you aren't an idiot.

How much weight did I expect you lost?  Maybe 1 or 2 pounds.  Not enough?  Too bad, losing weight is harder than gaining it.  Follow this diet continually.  If the first week you lose 5-10 pounds and the second week you ""gain back"" 3-5 pounds, don't sweat it, it was because you had different hydration levels (not drinking enough water the first week likely).

If you don't fit into the freakish 10% who can't lose weight normally (you aren't that special), and you don't lose 5 pounds by the end of the month I will eat my hat.  It's a very nice hat too.

Edit: Caveat, if you start eating say 2000 calories and burn MORE than 600 on exercise alone (this is per day remember, and that's the equivalent of running 4-5 miles) you may increase your intake so that you are at a calorie deficit of only 300-400 (through eating).  This is ONLY if you are burning these calories DAILY, not ""I'm going to run 5 miles so I can have cake tonight!""  A daily exercise routine of this intensity will require more food unless you like passing out at the gym or in traffic.  If you're burning more than 700 in exercise alone (daily) do not induce any calorie deficit through eating.

Questions:

  * Q: This diet isn't (generic form of healthy, good calorie/bad calorie, balanced, etc.)
  * A: This diet is NOT MEANT TO BE PERMANENT.  It is for people who need to lose 30 pounds and have never been able to do it.  Do not follow this post-weight loss.

  * Q: Can I eat pizza?
  * A: Are you in a calorie deficit?

  * Q: Can I eat lots of carbs?
  * A: Are you still in a calorie deficit?

  * Q: My doctor said...
  * A: Then why are you reading this?  Listen to your doctor you moron

  * Q: My bro told me...
  * A: I don't care

  * Q: I gained weight!
  * A: You aren't in a calorie deficit (or see exception, and pretend you'll be fat forever because you won't visit the doctor)

  * Q: Can I eat cake?
  * A: THE CAKE IS A LIE

  * Q: But...but...carbs, sugar...cats...
  * A: Are pretty meaningless if you're trying to lose more than 30 pounds, and you also didn't read the post

  * Q (or A): The human body is too complex for such a simple plan
  * A: You didn't try it (or don't need to) and you can't see the forest for all the trees (bro science, diet plans, weekly diet article, etc.).  Break them down and get back to me.  Or not, because you never do you dirty whores.

  * Q: What sound does a murlock make?
  * A: MWAWAWRGLRLGLRLG!

**Edit:** I never claimed this was a permanent diet nor should you assume so for obvious reasons.  I've enjoyed poking giant holes in some claims (you can eat fewer calories than you burn in a day and still gain weight!) and revealing others (your method doesn't work because I didn't follow it and gained all my weight back).  Eating fewer calories than you burn remains the simplest and truest diet plan regardless of naysayers and people who like to make multiple accounts to downvote because they disagree with what I say.  I said it straight and didn't tell you to eat toast over bacon or some other bullshit that will drive you insane after a week of trying to plan 7 straight meals.  I wish you all the weight loss you need for you big losers, and all the willpower with it!

I want to explain to he/she/it that language evolves, and attempting to restrict the way it is used in order to resist change is ultimately pointless, because in less than one thousand years, English will be completely different.  Just attempt to read Old English.

This is one of the reasons I LOVE hip-hop.  Black English Vernacular changes yearly.  There is always new slang and new and innovative ways of saying things, for example, the word Trill (True + Real... and imagine how that could be used in writing, specifically poetry).  Standard English is restricted by tradition, taught in grade school and forced down our throats in high school and college, and ultimately enforced by dictionaries and grammar nazis.  They gave me a framework that I hate.  

Every time I see that Louie CK bit about how being white is ""clearly better"" than being black, I think to myself, ""Fuck that!  Who wants to be put in a box.  If you think you are any more free than the black man, because you would be seated at any time period in the past, just look at the box you've been put in that allows you to believe such nonsense."" (Obviously, Louie CK is making a joke, and making a point about how fucked up society is, but some of his audience stupidly laughs along like, ""Durr Being white kicks ass."")  Anyone who believes such a thing may not be socially oppressed, but they damn well are metaphysically oppressed, and at the end of the day I'd take being socially oppressed over the fucking stain on the conscience of all white men who benefit from this fucked up society...  And on top of all that, I'd be able to understand and properly/believably use one of the most rapidly changing languages in the world.

Basically for the past 5 years or so I've developed one bitch of an eating disorder/phobia.

20068," It was interesting to here everyone's ideas on what Internet Spaceships will be like in 10 years.  I read everyone's posts and then I smoked a bunch of weed and this what I came up with:


 Obviously CCP is interested in expanding the role of planets.  Planetary Interaction on the Eve end combined with Dust 514 on console is a pretty novel idea and shows that they are willing to take some risks to make a cool game experience. They will also tap a new well with Dust: the console FPS gamer. Big money to made there.


 I think there is another game play type that they have many pieces in place for and that's the Civilization gamer. Planetary management could expand to include things like government type, with different government types having advantages and disadvantages. To take this even further, imagine spending more of the planets resources on education for the population t result in better research and manufacturing in POS's since capsuleers are wealthy and could recruit(kidnap, whatever) the best minds to work on the stations. There are a million ways this could go but basically just mash Civilization, sov, and planetary management together and you get a whole new, fairly deep, aspect of Eve that attracts one more niche gamer type.


 For the actual planet experience, Dust 514 will probably be moderately successful but I doubt it's the next Halo. Even so, I think CCP will take what they learn from Dust and combine the FPS aspect into Eve proper. You would train skills for FPS combat just as you would a ship. On the planets they would be FPS clones which you can download to from any station. Enemy alliances could drop clone factories onto your planets and you would have to fight to destroy their factory while they would fight to destroy your clone factory. If your clone factory gets destroyed then you can no longer protect your assets on the ground and materials production, research, whatever, would be disrupted, costing the alliance enough to make it worth protecting. 


 Of course there would have to be some type of matching system to make this work. I think something along the lines of hiring mercenaries to fight in your place when you aren't there would work. Mercenaries wouldn't be like merc corps are now though. It would have to be a separate system where you can pay X amount of ISK to have level 1 players battle for your side and X*10 to have the top tier players battle of your side. Essentially, whoever pays the most gets the most skilled FPSers to fight for them. Under this system, FPSers would just log onto there Xbox or PC and jump right into the game, oblivious to the alliance they are fighting for but alliance members could jump clone down and fight for their side. The pure FPS players (Dust players) would be able to buy faction guns and armor, etc, and alliances could put some of those new planetary resources to work producing guns for themselves. This could be expanded to include invading enemy titans as well though again there are some time frame issues to be worked out.


 Taking the long view, I think CCP wants to expand the audience that their games are attractive to(and thus get mo' money) and since they have said they want to turn Eve into the ultimate sci-fi game, I think we can look forward some interesting stuff coming to Eve in the future.

20088,"I work at a hospital posted outside right at the front door, so as you can imagine, I see all types.  And there's tons of HBs, I'm fortunate in that area.  I'm a recovering AFC but I've definitely learned a lot over the past few months after randomly picking up The Game by Neil Strauss (couldn't put it down), and reading Seddit.   I've had plenty of interactions, and I'm becoming more natural, but I still have a lot about myself I need to work on, mainly escalating.  Fear of rejection, possibly.  Working on that.  So while I'm in a good mood after reading some brilliant insight from LesbianPUA (link below) I thought I'd share what happened today.

There was a HB7 walking by all day going out for smoke breaks, and we definitely made eye contact at least once and I gave her the smile.  We've met before a few weeks ago when it was raining hard and she came out and smoked in the shelter.  We just small talked, as I was on the job and couldn't give her 100% attention.  Today she was in and out and over time I was finally able to go out for a smoke myself while she was out there.  I approached from an angle, my car was nearby so I made a pit stop to switch lighters.  I'm positive she saw me coming the minute I stepped away from post.  After my pit stop and walked straight over to her.  We chatted flirtatiously for about 10 minutes.  She was clearly interested.  At least that's how it looked to me any way.  Eventually, after negging her on her smoking habit, and discussing things we had in common, I told her that I was going to ask her out to lunch but I had missed her.  She said, ""OK, how about we meet out here again in an hour?""

""OK sounds good.""  Then we walked slowly back to the door talking for a while, then parted ways.

One hour passed but I didn't see her.  Then each minute after that got slower and slower.  Another hour passed and I still hadn't seen her.  It was time for me to go home, so I did.

What I'm thinking is that this is a good thing.  If she's interested in me now after weeks, why would she forget about me today?  It's possibly a shit test, and here's where I'm a little hazy.  She could be testing me to see if I'm just gonna hit it and quit it.  Currently the plan is to give her shit about flaking on me in a playful manner, using kino if possible.

Or I could be wrong and she's not interested.  But I have nothing to lose, so why not try again?

20117,"Recent finance grad here looking for some input - How do I break into finance if I have no professional experience?

My situation:

I graduated in May with a Bachelor's in finance and have been looking for employment since. Like many of my peers, I did not succeed in finding an internship my junior year. Due to obvious market circumstances coupled with a foolish mentality at the time of not wanting to settle for a position with a company I didn't really want to work for, I ended up with no experience. I see now that any relevant experience would've been invaluable even if the company name did not build my resume itself.

What I have done in the last six months:

I have combed through postings on career sites (Monster, Careerbuilder, etc.) and corporate career pages with no luck. I have created profiles with all the major finance staffing/temp firms in my area, only to hear back from one which has yet to come up with any position that fits my profile. I have contacted alumni from my school and have been met with little useful advice and no leads. 

I am beginning to think that finding a job will be a pure stroke of luck and has nothing to do with working hard to get there. I am running out of ideas as well as optimism. I have confidence in my career potential, but can't find a way to develop it. 

Why I'm posting this here:

Maybe someone here knows something I don't or has a piece of advice that could be useful. Maybe you're looking for someone like me. Maybe you are someone like me and this will give you solace in the fact that you're not alone.

To be fair, she's probably disappointed because her grandchildren and descendants through me most likely won't have my dad's last name, but she didn't seem that sad or angry with all the prejudice and mistreatment I've gone through (even today) just because of how my name sounds in English.  Even if I let it all go, I never liked the sound of my name anyway and feel the new name I've chosen is better professionally.  

Some of my friends know, I haven't broken it to most however.  Some of my friends are really good friends and I'd let them call me by my birth name if they wished, other people can just screw off and either call me by my new name or not talk to me again.

Maybe some of my motivations are a bit questionable or ill-founded, but I take great solace when I don't have to lie when I say I'm not my old name.

I'm fully aware of what I'll need to do to get a new SS card, driver's license, update info at financial institutions, etc. and I'm fully prepared to take responsibility for such things.

Anyone who's changed their name willing to share their experience of adjusting after they changed their name?  Stories of altered relationships with other people, or any hassles with updating information at a lot of places?  I know it varies state by state, but my lawyer did say I can still use my old name as long as it's not to defraud.

21357,"I notice that the default reason given for the fact that the Democrats aren't in power (or are losing power) is that the American populace is simply dumb (or uninformed).

The Democrats have given the people no reason to vote for them. They have ""progressive policies,"" sure, but they're so unprincipled that they give them up at the slightest urging from the right wing. Healthcare reform MIGHT have gotten support, except that they couldn't explain to people *why* it would help them. The best part of it - the public option - would have helped millions of poor Americans, but they were not willing to push one inch to get it passed. Even Kucinich (that beacon of principle!#), who absolutely PLEDGED not to vote for the bill without the public option, had a talk with his wife and decided that he should, in fact, vote for it. And all along, the Democrats were so apathetic about the bill that they allowed the Republicans to frame it however they wanted at every turn. 

Let me ask you this: if you are an ""average"" American, and you do not care all that much about supporting gay marriage or gun control, what appeal do the Democrats have? Will the limited healthcare ""reform"" actually substantially help you? Will the Democrats ever make a popular appeal to you? Will they ever say ""Fuck the bankers!"" Or will they meekly, timidly, accept whatever the Republicans say with perhaps a small cry of ""hey! that's not fair!""

If you ask me, the Democrats are just Republicans with a little more (public) shame for the policies with they, in effect, support by their complacency. If you ask me, the American people aren't stupid - they have no good options and only one of those options seems willing to fight for their position. 

And if you ask me, those who call the people ""stupid"" are nothing other than elitists who do not understand the reality faced by millions upon millions of Americans to whom the Democrats are just one of the two political parties which have screwed them over their whole lives.

Once we have a clear Mission Statement we can bounce our ideas off the statement to see if the idea is truly beneficial to the overall project. If the idea passes this simple vetting process we can add it to an initiative section of the wiki.

A mission statement has three parts. 
* What are the needs we exist to address?
* What are we doing to address these needs?
* What are the principles that guide our work?
 

**ProjectCairo - Mission Statement**

On November 30, 2010 we learned of Cairo, Illinois. A community on its way to longevity and prosperity cut short by the mistakes by a few. ProjectCairo was set up with the combined hopes by the Reddit community to right the wrongs of the past and give this town a second chance. To turn this town around ProjectCairo plans to establish a presence in the community. Once established we will be begin to revitalize the community and economy. It is our philosophy that mountains can be moved by the kindness of strangers. We cannot do this alone, however, and hope with the community's help, we can restore Cairo to the town that it should have been.

However, I'll have you know (sonny!) that i pay all of my other bills on time and only speed occasionally.  Also, I didn't think it would come to this... :-/

So, I currently drive a car registered in my wife's name (I am on the insurance).  Back in March, she received a letter from a company called SpeedSafe that operates red light &amp; speed cameras around the city we live in.  In the letter addressed to her it stated that she had been photographed speeding and needed to pay a fine of $35.  The letter included a picture of me driving the car.

Now, I used to work in law enforcement and I still have lots of cop buddies, most of which encouraged us to throw the letter in the trash and not pay them.  Many of us feel the cameras do not make us safer, do not prevent accidents, and most of all just creep us out in general (if not violate some kind of privacy rights or something).  The speed camera company in my city is a company contracted out by the city government to collect fines based on photographic evidence, and they are run by law firms that operate out of other states.  They have no ""legal"" authority, so you can't go to jail for not paying them, however they do have the ability to report the uncollected fines to credit bureaus.  In essence, they are simply debt collectors.  But I digress...

The letter stated she had three options: 1) pay the fine, or if she wanted to dispute the fine, 2) tell them why she was disputing it, or if she was not the person in the picture 3) send them the information of the person in the picture.  Naturally, she returned the letter with my information in the correct places asking them to remove her name from the ""fine"" and put mine in instead.  At this point, we probably should have just sent them the money but the only thing on her mind was getting her name off of this ""debt collection"" and I object to the whole idea of ""speed cameras"" in general so I wasn't going to send them money until I felt I had to.  Besides, what if we weren't husband and wife, and she had let a friend borrow her car?  She shouldn't have to pay the fine for her friend's speeding...

About 2 weeks later she gets a letter back from them stating that she needed to get a form notarized saying that I was the one who was in the picture, otherwise it wasn't a ""legal document"" and couldn't be used to remove her name and put mine in it's place.  On top of that, they tacked on a $40 ""late payment"" fee.  Well, that didn't sit well with her.  Why should she have to pay a notary fee to prove herself innocent?  Shouldn't *they* have to prove *her* guilty??  So at this point I took over and sent them a letter (acting as her) citing various parts of the Fair Debt Collection Act or whatever and demanding that they either refrain from sending any more correspondence regarding this matter OR take her to court, at which point she would clearly be shown ""innocent"" (since it's obviously not her in the picture) and she would counter sue for court costs, attorney fees, lost wages, and punitive damages.

Well, we never heard back from them so we figured they'd just decided it wasn't worth the trouble... until today.  We got a letter from a *different* law firm stating that we had a debt of $75 past due and needed to pay in full immediately.  Naturally I am going to send them the same letter I sent before, just edited slightly for relevance.  But, now I am left wondering:  Will they just keep selling the debt to other collectors and making her (me) dispute it each time??

At this point I feel like it's too late to just pay it since it will show as a ""late paid debt"" on her credit report, whereas if they just switch the debt to my name I couldn't give a shit less if mine shows it. 

TL;DR **can a debt collector, once advised to discontinue contact with you, simply sell the debt to a new collector and effectively cancel out the 'do not contact' order?**",-1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
21956,"Playing Super Meat Boy made me remember how much I love timed jump and run games, but one thing always bothered me.
I kinda think leaderboards or highscores are stupid, both mean you just grind the same stage over and over until you get that one perfect run even though it could have taken you days it doesn't matter.
In my opinion it's way more interesting to see who gets the best time in only a few lives or under a time limit, maybe even on a brand new course.

Then it hit me, games like super meat boy need a multiplayer that works exactly like Trackmania.
2-24 player join a server, a certain stage starts and everybody gets 2-5 minutes depending on the stage to get the best time, points are awarded according to your placing and after 10-20 stages the player with the must points win (duh)

I think this would be a tremendously fun multiplayer, you may have the top score on a stage, but what when you have to act under time pressure?

This would be even more perfect if the game has an editor like trackmania.

23015,"I graduated from college a few years ago and moved home.  I wanted to take a year off before going to graduate school, and during that year I wanted to work and save money for a trip to europe (something i wanted to do and i figured that if I didn't go before grad school, I might never get to go).  

While home, I met a foreign girl who was working here in the States temporarily on a two-year visa.  When we met, she had one year left on her visa; similarly, I was scheduled (applied/accepted) to go away to grad school the next year (thus, we were both due to leave at about the same time).  In my mind, it was supposed to be a perfect, mutually beneficial 'fling.'  Anyway, during that year, we did *really* well together.  She ended up meeting my family, my friends, etc.  She was awesome: fun, pretty, kind.  I showed her one hell of a middle-class American lifestyle, and in return she was my right-hand girl.  It was an amazing year that we got to share with each other.

We never really talked about our official status, which I assumed was because we knew this could not really go anywhere.  And it didn't matter, we were having so much fun.  However, on two separate, chronologically-space-apart occasions, I stopped us before hooking up and told her that we should stop seeing each other because I didn't want her to get hurt.  Both times, she never really responded, and we ended up just hooking up. 

[Note: She's two years older than me and said (in previous conversation) that she had had a 2+ year and a 1+ year relationship before coming to the USA.   I much less experienced with serious relationships--during college I had about three 6-12 month relationships, in addition to several hook-ups--but I just told her that I had had two 1 year relationships.]  

A few months after I had met this girl, I booked in advance that trip to europe I wanted.  [For timeline purposes: I meet this girl in August, then 4 months later in January I book a trip to Europe for May-June.]  Before I left for Europe, we never really discussed anything about 'us'.  When I went to Europe, more girls than I'm used to were into me.  It felt (on a smaller scale) like the movie Eurotrip--and, I ended up hooking up.  I didn't regret it at the time, and even today, I feel like it was something I needed to experience and 'get out of my system'.  Also, the logic in my head was that ""there is no way anything long-term could happen with this foreign girl from home.""  Regardless of this stuff, the Europe trip was a highlight of my life--I met many interesting and awesome people.  Anyway, when I got home, she came to greet me and I couldn't even kiss her.  She knew and stormed away.  

She was pissed for a few weeks and we didn't talk, but her visa was expiring soon (in about two weeks).  But we had had such an amazing time together that year that I don't think she could stand not spending her little remaining time with me...I felt the same way.    

We lived up our last two weeks together.  Then she leaves and we say ""goodbye"".  

Fast forward two months.  She is back home, unhappy.  I never went to grad school (not really because of her, it was something I had been questioning the whole year).  

We video chat and stuff, and she intends to fly back in a few months to the states to see me and her host family (in addition to me, she had formed a close relationship with her host-family).  U.S. Immigration denies the request.  A few more months.  Denied again.  And again.  Turns out, US Immigration doesn't like single, foreign girls flying here too quickly after they had already been her for two years.  They are 'flight risks.'  

So, it's been a year now and I have still not seen her.  I was going to visit her this summer, but chickened out last minute.  Once again, she was not happy with me.  But I kind of got cold feet last minute, and the thought of taking a flight half way around the world by myself to see a girl scared the shit out of me.  

We haven't talked since my failed flight (a few months ago).  Recently, she just got her visa approved and will be coming to US for a short visit.  ""Facebook Officially"" she is visiting her host family, but she sent me an e-mail that she wants to meet up.  What do i do, Reddit?

Since she left, I have not been able to bring myself to hook up with another girl.  It's been VERY difficult on my heart, my mind, and, yea, my...weaponery.  I think she has hooked up with a guy or two back home, but I know that she's not seriously seeing anyone else.  But I'm not really worried about that, because I feel like it's up to me.   It's just really a shitty situation--we don't even have a 'title'.  She'd love to come to America and live here make the relationship work, but she actually can't. She has made an effort, and can't.  I feel like the ball is in my court, but I honestly don't know what the fuck to do with it.  I don't think that we could just be ""hook ups"" or have ""no title"" again, because that didn't seem to work out the first time. A long distance relationship (especially this long) seems like climbing Mount Everest without a coat on.  And it's not even temporarily long distance.  It's long distance for a long time.   But i don't know if I have the heart to break up with her; she's awesome and I don't really want to move on from her.   

Now that she has her visa, she can visit here monthly. Her job would allow this.  Also, she does get free flights (family member is an airline employee).  But that would mean she'd fly here once a month, at most.  I'm not ready for marriage, and seeing her once a month just seems really difficult.  

Note: I'm 24 and she is 26.  She is one of the most serious 'relationships' I've ever had in my life.  She said she had had two serious relationships before me.  

Anyway, I'm running out of ideas and I could use some advice...

EDIT:  In sum, I like this girl.  I like hanging out with her and spending time with her and getting her involved in my interests.  She's fun.  But I don't know how to go at least 25 out of 30 days per month without her.  And I just don't feel comfortable marrying yet. But I don't really want to move on.

The game was a fairly standard gem matching type thing with the following tweaks:

* I think it was set underground in a sort of maze, the aim was to match gems to remove the earth/rock they were set in, to allow a liquid (lava maybe?) to flow through the gem maze to reach some sort of goal/orb thing before a timer ran out. 
* Gems could be matched in any direction, they just had to touch. Using the mouse you could drag through any number of connecting gems and once you'd got past 3/4 there would be a small explosion at the final gem, blowing away more of the underlying rock, allowing the lava free passage.
* There were a number of different powerups, the only one I really remember was a shovel which allowed you to dig out some of the dirt to let the lava through to new areas.

So, where's your line?

I've removed the pics for privacy, but I think it's safe to say that I'm average looking.  I posted my photos to Hot or Not and one got voted a 9 of 10.  Okcupid sent me a message to say enough women rated my photo highly so that they're now showing me better looking profiles.  I do smile in my photos even though blog.okcupid says not to.   

**Do my messages suck?**
Each of the 50 were was brief, mentioned something from the woman's profile, and asked an open ended question.  Here's an example:

&gt; Drawing, writing, music - you sound like a creative virtuoso :) 
&gt; How do you find time for video games? I'm a big fan of Chris Van 
&gt; Allsburg for children's books. I got my BFA, but these days drawing

If you were to catch your twelve-ish year old child looking at pornography on the internet, what would you do? Would you get upset, and punish the child severely? Or would you do like I would now, and simply try to have a conversation with your child about sex, the human body, and the onset of hormones and the changes experienced during adolescence?

Soon a beautiful bloom of algae spread and grew across the rock. The algae oozed and shed globs of proteins. Chains and cells and fuzzes and foams turned to slimes and bacterias and bugs and lizards. Spines grew. Limbs sprouted. Creatures took their first steps onto land. Toes curled fresh, dry dirt. In no time at all, grasses and small mammals were being roasted and spitted over fires. Clothes were braided together from various foliage and fibers. Houses, then roads were constructed. Villages and towns and cities splotched across the lands. We constructed great things! Airplanes, ocean liners, cars, radios, telephones, bombs. We plotted our land with farms and factories and infrastructure. Machines gave us power, computers gave us knowledge. We created the Internet! Information at our fingertips, communication effortless, items procurable. One day your father and mother bought you a fish, and you were fascinated by it. You spent summer days whittling alabaster into sunken ships and treasure chests to place in your fishbowl. Then you went back to school, then to college, and off to work.

Home at 7pm to your family, who ate dinner together every night. On holidays you visit your childhood home, and there in a hallway closet is that fishbowl, and you are transported back to that summer and your fish. And you decide you will buy a great big fish tank for your family. You select many fish along with pristine decorations and expensive food. And you get on the Internet one day, and you come across a Chinese website that sells decorative knick-knacks. You mistrust the vendor, but it's given you ideas for your fish tank, which you take to the Internet again. You come across a listing for a rock -- a beautiful, craggy thing that will look spiffy in your fish tank. Click purchase, and it is at your door. You open the box and pick up the rock: It is perfect, and the kids will think it is fine. You hurriedly get up from the table, and the rock falls to the floor and splits in two pieces. Zounds! Maybe super glue or epoxy. But as you inspect the rock, a pungent and vile odor wafts into your face. There are black spores on your hand. Disgusting, you think.

 Most of the advice/ FR's I see here is more directed at club game, My question is, do you guys have any advice specific to pickup in a concert setting? 
(just for some background info, the majority of the shows in this town are basement shows, where people hang outside, smoke, talk,  until the band plays, then pile into the basement during the set.)

EXTORSIONAN A KÍNDERES CON AUTOPLAGIO

EL NORTE Monterrey, México (2 diciembre 2010).- Dos kínderes particulares del poniente de la Ciudad fueron blanco de una nueva e increíble forma de extorsión por parte de delincuentes.

Bajo amenazas, los criminales presuntamente obligaron a que dos grupos de maestras y niños se ""autoplagiaran"" en moteles por más de nueve horas, después de las cuales todos fueron localizados ilesos.

Con esta extorsión, los delincuentes recibieron 20 mil pesos, explicó ayer el director de la Agencia Estatal de Investigaciones (AEI), Adrián de la Garza.

Al confirmar las versiones que corrieron desde el martes por la noche, el mando policiaco dijo que los extorsionadores llamaron ese día por la mañana al Centro Infantil Pedro Infante de la Colonia Hacienda Santa Clara y a otra escuela del mismo nombre en la Colonia Barrio San Luis, en Ciudad Solidaridad.

Ambos planteles, que no están en zonas de alto nivel socioeconómico, son propiedad de una misma persona, que no fue identificada por De la Garza.

Las llamadas a los colegios, añadió el director de la AEI, fueron hechas el martes alrededor de las 11:00 horas por extorsionadores que convencieron a las maestras de que tenían gente armada afuera de los planteles y que podían entrar en cualquier momento si no accedían a sus peticiones.

En los dos casos, los delincuentes dieron nombres de alumnos que estaban en los salones, lo que causó mayor temor entre las maestras, que, de acuerdo al funcionario, no llamaron a la Policía.

Las instrucciones que dieron a las maestras suenan a guión de película.

A las educadoras del colegio ubicado en Hacienda Santa Clara les ordenaron que llevaran a niños al Supermotel, en la Avenida Rangel Frías, donde debían permanecer encerrados hasta nueva orden, dijo el jefe de la Ministerial.

Una orden similar fue dada al plantel de Ciudad Solidaridad, aunque les dijeron que fueran al motel Portobello, ubicado en la Colonia Ex Ejido San Bernabé.

En total, dijo De la Garza, 10 alumnos y ocho profesoras se ""autoplagiaron"" en los moteles.

Como rescate, agregó, el dueño de los colegios depositó 8 mil pesos a una cuenta de Banco Ahorro Famsa, mientras que familiares de una de las maestras depositaron 12 mil pesos en una cuenta de Banamex.

Los ministeriales se enteraron de las extorsiones por terceras personas y localizaron a alumnos y maestras en los moteles, alrededor de las 20:30 horas.

No obstante, indicó el funcionario, hasta anoche no se había presentado ninguna denuncia.

De la Garza pidió que las extorsiones se reporten a los teléfonos de la AEI: 2020-4590, 92 y 93.

The landlord rents out the 3 rooms in my apartment separately, so I don't have a say in who moves in. She is a pretty sketchy woman but I like the location and price. There are just two of us in the apartment right now. I don't see the new roommate often. He works the night shift at Dunkin Donuts. I work a 9-5 and I take grad classes at night. When I do see him he seems strung out, his face is red, and eyes kinda bugged out. 

Yesterday I went into his room and found a needle and multiple pink pieces of wax paper with some sort of stamp on it. He also had a prescription for both lithium carbonate and pexeva. Last night he woke me up puking multiple times. I'm guessing he was having withdrawal. I stayed home from work today. He made a drug call right in front of me ten minutes ago and then told me he was going to the store. 

He is shooting up in his room right now. 

I don't feel like he will harm me in anyway but this is not the environment I want to live in. I have been here for 3 years and now is not a good time for me to move out. What should I do?

My brother likes to always hire professionals and buy expensive stuff because he's a lot more confident in their reliability.
My mother on the other hand is very frugal and tries to do everything herself.

Me? I think I lean in closer to my brothers point of view except of when I'm sure I can do something. ie: replacing a power supply on my computer. Don't need to pay $50 for someone to do that. A door lock change? My mom bought a new lock from a liquidation store and I think that is a bit much. I'd buy a good front door lock and try installing it myself probably. Things like painting the house seems too much work to do properly. So if it seems easy/I'll be able to do it decently I'll give it a shot. If it seems difficult/complicated/important then I'd just hire someone.

What about buying stuff? Well for most things I buy above average or average quality. I noticed when I buy dollar store earphones for example they always break within 2 months, so I opt to just buy $30 ones instead. To save time I'll go buy the 104.9 gas instead of the 101 gas 10 minutes away. And to make my life more pleasurable, I buy decent toilet paper (my mom buys on sale toilet paper and sometimes it is not very fun) instead of on sale stuff.

In this universe we are a possible consequence of this universe's constants, that I have no problem understanding. As to the fact that ours **is** the universe with these constants is harder to rationalise as even minute changes to any constant would result in it being impossible not only for cells to exist but even molecules. And it's not as if we can point to other universes of other constants and say that at least one of them would be hospitable akin to the hospitable planet argument.

I'm not saying that us humans are lucky to have the constants being what they are, I'm saying the possibility of any lifeform is impossible in most, if not all, other possible configurations of the constants.

3 months passed since August 19 and it was time for my essure verification to make sure my tubes are blocked.

Last Wednesday, I arrived little earlier than I expected so I had to wait 45 minutes until my appointment.

An hour before the exam, I took 500mg naproxen and 75mg fexmid. They were leftover from a car accident I was in back in October. I also wore gripping socks because from what I heard that all x-ray places have no stirrups.

The receptionist guided me to the dressing room. I removed my pants, wore a gown and waited in the tiny room with other people. 5 minutes later, the tech came and called me. She explained me about the procedure and some questions. She basically said the procedure would probably take between 15 to 30 minutes because it depends on the angle of my  cervix. She showed me a few things - iodine, x-ray dye, swabs, plastic speculum, and [cannula, catheter with syringe](http://www.v2.redi-tech.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/hsg.jpg). I made a face when I saw the cannula because it was huge like a pencil! She said I will feel little pain and moderate cramps. 

The radiologist came in and greeted me. I laid on the cold, hard table with a pillow under my head. The speculum was inserted. He applied a swab with iodine into my cervix. The tech held my left leg and I felt a sharp pain when the cannula was inserted into my cervix but it went away in 2 seconds. I thought it was nothing... until the injection of the dye. The pain took me by surprise. My eyes welled up and my legs trembled. The pain scale between 1 to 10 for my cramps on period is 4 but this pain is 12! It was intense like.. a thousand of needles stabbing in my uterus. I could only imagine what it felt like to be kicked down there if I was a guy.

The pain subsided but the radiologist injected again. Argh, the pain came back again. I thought I was going to pass out because I was feeling very light-headed. That moment, I wanted to kick his face! I grasped my jacket, I covered my eyes and held my breath. The tech came to me, held my hand and said ""It is okay. It is almost done."" She asked me to roll to the left then to the right and in the fetal position too.

Everything took only five minutes but I felt like much longer than that. The tech told me to rest a little bit. I had an awkward moment with the radiologist. He asked me why did I have essure? He thought I was too young. I simply told him that I don't want kids. He was kind of appalled. He walked out without saying goodbye or a handshake. I was glad he asked me after that because he could refuse to do the procedure if he knew before that. The tech apologized but she gave me great news that I'm 100% blocked. YAYYYYYY! :D She said I can lay down for ten minutes or until I am ready to go but I told her that I am definitely ready to leave. I didn't want to lay down because I live 2 hours away and I wanted to beat rush hour. The tech was little concerned and wanted to make sure I'm not dizzy or light-headed. I kept telling her that I am perfectly fine and I don't have cramps. She gave me a pad and wet wipe. I was fine but the hard part was walking. My legs were still shaking but I managed to get out of the building with my SO.

I didn't have cramps except feeling bloated from dye. It discharged after few hours. 

Yesterday and today, I feel little pulling sensation in my uterus but besides that, I'm great. No bleeding or pain. 

I didn't have a chance to see my x-ray but I found three examples on google.

I've worked in three different cognitive psychology labs studying the nature of visual attention, memory and cognition.

The kind of research we do is published in reputable peer reviewed journals like Nature Neuroscience and Cognition.  
 
Now to me, all this seems fairly scientific to me.  Yet I often see arguments that psychology is not a science. I believe this is a big, ugly over-generalization, but it frustrates me that the general perception of psychology -- including scientific thinkers who should know better -- is that we're a bunch bobble-headed Freudians and fluffy Deanna Trois.  Not that those types shouldn't necessarily have a place in psychology, but the fact they dominate public perception does bother me a bit.  I've come to the point where I describe myself as a student of cognitive science rather than psychology, despite the fact that I will most likely be getting my PhD in psychology.

30471,"It is not a coincidence these 2 things happened in the same week. They now see the need to control the internet. Is it controllable? For now maybe...but not forever. 

One thing is for sure..... Pandora's box has been opened.  I see a future that cannot be controlled.  The internet is going to change itself so it can keep growing. It will decentralize. I see a future where the internet is not controlled by a few servers and can be just switched off to suit an agenda. But a future where every cellphone and electronic device can be turned into a broadcasting hub for information. As wifi strengths increase/and hard drives increase in size we will all become walking servers...housing everything. Forming a mobile internet. Beacons projecting out who we are and what we believe. All walls will be glass. Truth will win. It is the only thing that doesn't die in direct sun light. Truth is what we are all searching for everyday of our lives in every aspect of our lives.

Politicians can stop one or two people...now. But once a million people start broadcasting news from around the world from their pockets and homes...When anything written is instantly shared with everyone...Well then it will become a place where anyone who lies cannot hide. A future where an honest man has nothing to fear.


Goverments are slow to react and understand. They don't know that the fight is hopeless. They might win a battle but the future war is already won. Secrets in a day and age of information will end. I don't think that is a bad thing. Living a truthful honest life is one of the happiest lives a person can live. If you are in goverment...give up trying to control information. Spend your time helping people in other ways and do the job you are paid to do. In the future you will be remembered like the priests who tried to censor the truth that the earth was not the center of the universe. They are laughed at and thought of as fools. There is no difference today with these truths. Truth wants to win. 

Act like the heroes you were elected to be. Total freedom of information is coming. Wikileaks showed us this. In 100 years I think this defining moment will be how Obama and all of you in power will be remembered. What he did and said at this point in history.

Do you not realize the internet is the history book of tomorrow. It will be able to be scrubbed back to this day.  Children will study the day of Dec 1st 2010 and know who was right and who was wrong. Did all of you embrace freedom. Or did you fight it. Or did you say nothing and miss your chance to be remembered. 

The truth will win one day. Why not make it win today.  ",1,-1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-1,-1,-1,0,-1,-1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-1,-1,-1,0,-1,-1,0

So today marks another foray by an Asian actor (Jang Dong-gun in “The Warrior’s Way”) into the interracial miasma that is Hollywood. Unlike the upcoming movie “Green Hornet” where Jay Chou plays the beta Asian to Seth Rogen’s lead role, the lead role in “The Warrior’s Way” is that of an Alpha Asian.

It even has Kate Bosworth in the first Asian Man White Woman interracial movie kiss in years (assuming they even kiss). That’s a rare occurrence in the media if there ever was one: like a unicorn or a pot of gold at the end of a rainbow is the Alpha Asian Man.

If I sound jaded and skeptical, it’s because I am. Especially when it comes to anything regarding Asian men in mainstream media. I almost never saw any positive and masculine Asian male role models growing up. And if you haven’t figured it out, this article isn’t really a movie review so much as a review of the current state of Asian Masculinity as we approach the closing days of 2010 here in the 21st century.

After an angst ridden college career, I simply stopped caring what occurred on TV and in the movies. So I moved on and started trying to be my own hero (which is like building a sandcastle when the tide is coming in, but that’s another story). Nowadays, when I ask my students who is the most positive and masculine Alpha Asian role model they can think of, they all invariably reply with Bruce Lee!

An awesome role model and Alpha Asian, to be sure with his philosophical synthesis of the martial arts and media prowess, but the man has been dead for like 30 years!!! That’s just sad (and no, Jackie Chan doesn’t and Chow Yun Fat only counts overseas).

And somehow along the way, I- that rapscallion dandy and pickup artist, the Asian Playboy- became that Alpha Asian role model to thousands of other Asian Americans (and Asians in Great Britain to Australia). A heavy responsibility and a role I’m not entirely certain why I was thrust into, but here I am anyways. A servant to a deep cultural need that no one else was fulfilling.

For example, here’s one fanmail that moved me deeply, from Huy (personal details changed):

Dude. I’m a first generation America Vietnamese kid born in the ghettos of Los Angeles. I just graduated now I am proudly serving the nation as a tank driver and American Soldier stationed in [redacted] with the [redacted] division. I just wanted to say that you’re my hero =] you helped me believe that I could amount to something more than nail salons and pho restaurants.

- HUY (Los Angeles, California)

It moves me because I have to ask, who the hell am I to be anyone’s hero much less someone who risks their lives everyday?!

I just teach guys how to be successful with women. I don’t save lives. Hell, William the Better Asian Man is out there saving real lives as a weekend volunteer for the FDNY. I just help my Asian brothers go out there and get laid with just about any women they want out there.

This kid here is actually going to be out there on the FRONT LINES protecting our freedoms with his life and he thinks *I’m* a hero?!

Anyways, I think being a role model to thousands of men around the world in order become their own Alpha Asian has forced me to find other sources of role modeling, from my own mother to the spiritual teachings of the Buddha. But at the same time, looking back on my own formative years, it would have been of great help to see me, my own reflection and values, in others as they would see themselves.

And that’s where the media comes in.

Although I still contend that changing the media won’t have that big of an effect on AMs as many seem to believe, it’s still heart warming to see and has turned what was simply a guilty pleasure into one of my favorite TV shows, Glee, and see Harry Shum playing another potential Alpha Asian, Mike Chang. As his character arc progresses, I see many positive traits that I think other Asian boys, in the cusp of manhood, should emulate in order to be more confident, masculine, sexual, successful and ultimately the Alpha Asian they were meant to be.

While I haven’t seen the movie “The Warrior’s Way” yet (I’ve got my LAST bootcamp of 2010 to run this weekend after all), I do hope to catch it on Monday to properly review it and I do hope it doesn’t suck as so many other movies before it has (like Jet Li’s non-kiss in “Romeo Must Die” with Aaliyah). Yes, it’s another chop-socky, kung fu, ninja movie (like Jung “Rain” Ji-Hoon in “Ninja Assassin“), but I hope there are definite masculine, Alpha Asian characteristics in “The Warrior’s Way” that those of us who didn’t grow up with strong role models we can identify with.

So let me put forward my own list of what I contend are “Alpha Asian” characterstics that I hope to see in this movie “The Warrior’s Way” and other movies and TV shows, whether it’s John Cho in Star Trek to Daniel Dae Kim in the rebooted Hawaii Five-0.

An Alpha Asian Male is:

1) Athletic: The Alpha Asian plays competitive sports like football, basketball, and other full contact activities.
2) Creative: The Alpha Asian plays music, writes, draws, and is non-traditional nor a conformist.
3) Physical: The Alpha Asian understands his body whether it comes from dancing or working out.
4) Sexual: The Alpha Asian enjoys sex and believes women will enjoy it with him as well.
5) Cultured: The Alpha Asian understands where he came from and why it’s important.
6) Multicultural: The Alpha Asian is open to other cultures, whether it’s America to Europe to Ethiopians.
7) Compassionate: The Alpha Asian is compassionate and caring to his fellow brothers and sisters.
8) Assertive: The Alpha Asian is a leader and will speak up and act out when appropriate.
9) Dominant: The Alpha Asian will take charge, from the board room to the bedroom.
10) Courageous: The Alpha Asian understands fear, embraces it, and then moves forward despite it.

A wishlist to be sure, but here’s hoping that some good can come out of these movies. That some teenage Asian kid, unlike me those many moons ago, will be uplifted by seeing an Alpha Asian role model and push himself beyond his comfort. To be successful not only at school, but in his personal life and life in general.

Because ultimately, the mark of an Alpha Asian- the mark of any real man- is not his college education or his grades. It’s his ability to press on in the face of failure and fear no matter how many times he’s derided and insulted in order to accomplish his goals.

To embody all these 10 Alpha Asian traits that make him truly a man, and not simply a boy.",1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

After that I ended up friendless. I started visiting sites like omegle to chat with strangers so as to not to feel lonely. At omegle I made lot of friends with whom I used to chat with everyday. There I met a girl who wasn't from my country. I started chatting with her everyday. I liked chating with her and she too was very kind and caring. I started loving her, but when I expressed it to her she refused. I understand her decision considering I am almost a stranger to her. But I loved (love) her from the core of my heart. I am the kind of person who doesn't like fooling around with girls. I just want to get into one serious relation which would go on to the end, but I am sick that I loved someone the second time.

32117,"My boyfriend and I have been dating for 3 years. But the last 2 I've been doubting our sustainability. 

He's a law student. He's constantly busy. I try my hardest to support him, and not to bother while he's working on his education. It is by far the most important thing to him. 

So I try to occupy myself. I'm in school. I am working to be a nurse. I too am busy, but I'm just a sophomore. My schedule isn't as intense yet. 

So here's the dilemma. I feel my boyfriend has been using his school work as an excuse to get away from me. I know what some of you are probably thinking, ""Oh, what a chick thing to say. She's just over thinking things like every chick does."" But no. I've had this feeling ever since we had a huge fight when we were first dating. We continued to date afterwards, but it was never the same. He became more distant. He held secrets from me when I knew what was going on. He ignored my texts. My calls. My im's. Some nights I knew he was working. But others I knew he wasn't, but he would always say he was busy with school work. He still does that today. Even when I know for a fact what he does and when he does it he will ignore me. When I call him out, he uses school as the excuse.

I feel like I'm in that movie ""He's Just Not That In To You"".  There's also a few more issues. But I won't go into those. 

He says he loves me. He wants to marry me. 

And maybe I annoy him. That's possible. But I just wish he would tell me instead of make shit up.

and with a crippled head

he felt a sensation

he thought he felt before

it came with moderation

though growing more and more

They rushed like violent seas

drowning in them, he felt glad

He drew in his last breath

But when people do it ""for attention"" or out of depression, the concept just does not make any sense to me.

It was for attention or something like that.  Are these people just batshit crazy?  Or am I missing something here?  If someone can shed some light on why people do this I would love to understand.  I do not get it.

But every Friday/Saturday night when people go out (I'm a sophomore 19 shes a freshman 18) I always get jealous.  I'm worried she might get with someone else because of a previous relationship where the girl cheated on me.  I'm not sure how to break this feeling, with my first gf I had no thought that she would ever cheat on me.  But ever since my second gf cheating on me this has been an idea in the back of my mind.  I don't know what it is I can do to get rid of this jealousy, I honestly do believe that she only wants to be with me since she has said numerous times that she only wants to be with me, maybe thats just a ploy or whatever.  Of course this is a throw away since she checks reddit &gt;.&gt;  But I don't know how to feel since shes really attractive and I'm sure guys hit on her at parties that I'm not at since we don't always go out with each other on Friday/Saturday since we have different groups of friends of course.

32830,"Have you ever realized that there is nothing you want, that you have gotten everything which you have desired. The very same things which you understood would bring happiness has brought you nothing but indifference. You have loved ones, family, any material item you could dream of and yet you remain unhappy, why? You see I have realized that I have tried to pretend that something specific is causing, what may or may not be depression. I might be projecting depression, self consciencly because I want attention, I need to know what ails me or I just can’t grasp a hold of life. It could be that I spend my Fridays by myself, but is there a reason I keep pushing away people who want to be friendly. I am that self conscience or conceded. Maybe my depression is derived from not having any true passion. Video games are fun, but I wouldn’t truly care if my Xbox broke, water polo is fun but it’s not really a passion nor can I think of a way to make it so. I tried guitar, skateboarding, video making, computers, photography, writing, and well I enjoyed each but never felt any desire to continue. I guess I just don’t know who I am. Am I a nerd? Am I awkward? Am I funny? A jerk? Invisible? Weird? Somewhat popular? I cant figure out who I am, its not like tv where you realize you have a passion or talent in something, I know I need to work at being what I want myself to be. Everyone says to be yourself, I don’t know what that is. You could say I’m lonely, I’m a pestimist or that I need to find something that I can relate to. One option to help myself that I thought would work would be getting a girlfriend. But after I thought of this I cant help but think even if I did ask a girl out/to a dance, who’s to say that it wasn’t a pity ‘yes’, because that I cant handle, but if it was a ‘no’ I would probably go spiraling down. This I guess is much like an inferiority complex. Maybe my problem is not that I don’t know what I want it’s that I don’t want to take the risk for fear of failure or worse undeserved success. I want to say I have the perfect life, which I should because I live in great house in a great neighborhood, in a beautiful town in the greatest part of the best state; I go to probably the most stunning highschools for miles around, with amazing teachers you can’t find anywhere else. My friends are great, at least I think they are, they always are nice and considerate, that’s not to say we don’t goof around and make fun of eachother, but they are amazing friends. I have a great family, who very rarely fight, we all truly love each other, I am blessed. We are very well off, I have never heard any talks of money trouble, in fact I’m typing this on my personal 2300 dollar macbook. I should be grateful, and I am but no matter how many times I count my blessings, I continue to feel depressed. I don’t know if my mind is pretending to be depressed because I want to be a part of things that I;m not and I use it as a crutch. Or maybe I am depressed, but I can’t think of any reason as to why or howi could be depressed, how is it that in the media everyone with depression is depicted as having a reason, bully, abusive family, poverty, or life trauma. I have never had to deal with any of this and yet im miserable. I try to change my lifestyle because I keep thinking that maybe that will kickstart my motivation to do well anything. I feel no desire anymore to go hang out with friends, not like I truly ever have though, I spend my time watching tv and messing around on the computer, doing absolutely nothing. Part of the reason im depressed is I know I should be happy but I can’t seem to make myself be happy at all. I have depression. But hey who’s gonna listen, everyone will. I’m surrounded by those who love me, and im sure that anyone of them would take time out of their day to listen and help, but what do I tell them exactly im depressed, but I cant tell you why. Youre probably thinking why my family and friends haven’t noticed my depression, well I don’t let my grade slip mostly because I want to please those that have given me so much, but I truly have no motivation at all anymore and if you looked closely at my grades you could tell that in fact that non motivation is actually showing. I find myself wondering that if I killed myself would people notice or care, even if they did would it be genuine or would it be so as to not be a jerk, in my imagination, which I thought I could control it seems that only those that were really close to me cared as well as others who begin crying for the attention, even if they don’t themselves. Sometimes it’s not even me killing myself sometimes it’s just I died of heart attack or something. Maybe the reason I never thought I was depressed was because I thought I was sad that I wasn’t popular, but maybe I was depressed because I’m lonely, some of my closest friends have stopped hanging out with me and my other friends aren’t really more than eat lunch with, copy homework friends. Right now I probably have two close real friends and five others. Maybe im just sad that life is passing me by while I waste time alone watching tv. I find myself pondering how much weight the ceiling lamp can hold, the height of my closet , the circumference of my head or what the principal would say on the announcements at school if I indeed went through with it, which I won’t seriously, but I get depressed each time I realize that Im thinking these things because I know it will hurt my family if I did it, and sadly that’s the only reason I can think of but its enough to prevent me from even seriously considering it. My family probably has no idea that I feel this, I act happy around them, but I rarely am truly happy. I don’t enjoy lying but again I don’t what else to do. Sleep is my safe haven, it’s just me and my thoughts, nothing else. I wish could sleep more, but since I feel no motivation to complete even the simplest of tasks I end up staying up late often, it may be leading to insomnia. I don’t know, you see ive looked up symptoms of depression and I might have it but then I go onthinking that oh wait maybe im just thinking that because I read it here, or im misinterpreting to make myself fit the mold.

32994,"So there was this fourth century sect called the Gnostics. They believed that the God of Genesis - let's call him Jehovah - was a peculiar, deluded, narcissistic fool, who had wrongly convinced himself that he was the one and only God. They said: ""This is the first archon who took a great power from his mother.... And he is impious in his arrogance which is in him. For he said: 'I am God and there is no other God beside me,' for he is ignorant of his strength, the place from which he had come.""

Jehovah desired nothing more than to be glorified, but self-glorification leads to sweaty palms and unnatural hair growth. So he created beings with free will, in order that they could glorify him one-on-one and in small and large groups. Like the Republicans who would come after him, he believed free will could be controlled through the widespread application of ignorance. Then one day, the actual supreme God, whom Gnostics call the Unknowable God, experienced an unknowable thing that we might describe as wanting to put an end to the ridiculous Jehovah situation. So she sent her emissary, the serpent, into the Garden of Eden. The serpent taught mankind the truth, and mankind turned away from the miserable old fool Jehovah.

Jehovah, of course, was filled with vengeance and furious anger. He regretted creating mankind and wanted to destroy it. But Jehovah had required beings who could operate independently of himself, which meant their free will must emanate from a power beyond Jehovah's reach. Jehovah had unwittingly imbued each of his creations with a direct connection to the Unknowable God. Unable to erase free will, he instead filled men's souls with temptation, evil and sin, which he hoped would add so much noise that the signal from the Unknowable God would be overwhelmed.

From another, or perhaps the same, unknowable motivation, the Unknowable God continued to send emissaries such as Elijah, Moses, Buddha, Jesus and Mohammed, to reveal the truth and call on the people to listen to the signal, not the noise. Jehovah, of course, continues to try with all his might to discredit and destroy these emissaries, even going so far as to crucify one of them and spin crazy tales about blood sacrifice and eternal torment. But in fact, each and every one of us is independently able to connect to the true perfection. All we have to do is stop listening to Jehovah.

How can you make excuses like “Everything happens for a reason” or “It must meant he wasn’t the one.” or ""We were all put here for a special purpose.""

Everything that happens is a consequence of your own actions.

There isn’t a “one” for you. Not to throw statistics out here right now, but look at our divorce rate. Half of the married people realized their own spouse wasn’t the one. There are TONS of people that have never met a person who they were in a long term relationship with and we often forget that. There are people out there dying that have never even be married and currently single, sometimes not by choice.


I’m just so tired of something shitty happening and people accepting it like.. it’s just whatever. Nobody thinks “I fucked up and it ended.” or “Wow, she cheated on me so I dumped her.” It’s always it happens for a reason.. that unknown reason.

You CAN have a purpose in life, you CAN meet your amazing SO, you CAN work on something that's going downhill. But when people just watch their own lives get ruined and don't interfere or try to do something about it and blame it on fate, it makes me extremely angry. Of course accidents sometimes happen, but sometimes we fail to see that half the time we could have prevented or fixed something awful that happened, rather than looking away and justifying it with fate.

It’s as if knowing there’s a reason puts you at ease. What about the people who after whatever happened, slip into depression? What about the people who can’t handle it and kill themselves? What about somebody’s live being totally fucked up? Is THAT the reason you were expecting?

* Do we come across as elitist?

* Would you ever want to join us in our section to see what it's like?

Any ideas?

edit2: Changed the formatting of my La's to give a better idea of the cadence.

36523,"Totally unsolicited. You may or may not agree. However, I know a few of you in person, and I'm an observant person, so here goes:

First and foremost, DON'T BE A TROLL. Seems simple and obvious, don't it? If you're chatting with a girl, don't try to goad her with how much you know or how much she doesn't. Don't revert to sixth grad 'I hit you I like you' type behavior. 

Second: Never, ever talk about being 'forever alone' with girls- whether you're attracted to them or not. It's fine to chat with friends about wanting to find someone, that you're lonely, etc. Where guys get into trouble is actually being self-deprecating. It's not a good attitude to have, and even if you aren't attracted to the girl you're talking like this to, remember this: girls know other girls. A lot of times, girls *like* to hook up single friends together. And I know from experience- mine and others- that we don't want to hook a girlfriend up with someone bearing that attitude. 

Third: have a sense of humor about dating. If you don't, you'll self destruct in no time. If you fail, and fail hard- take a step back and realize how idiotic and silly dating is. Everyone fails. If someone does something idiotic, mean, or rude- like ditch you- try your best to laugh about it, realize they're a bitch/cunt/not worth your time, and move on. which leads me to..

Fourth: Approach a date with the expectation to have fun, not to fall in love. If you've managed to score a date with someone who intrigues you- mentally, physically, or -gasp!- both- head out looking forward to getting to know them. It's sexy when a guy is having a good time, and it's obvious when they're expecting something later on. 

Fifth: to meet girls you'll like, try meeting them in places YOU like. If you're a huge dork, go to lectures or other events (dorkbot, tech parties, etc). Conventions or lectures or other 'extracurricular' activities are great places to meet girls who are into the same general things you are. Start up a conversation. Be casual. I've always been much more receptive to random conversations during these daytime or casual get-togethers than bars, clubs, or fancier parties.

and here's one more thing about first dates: Movies are shitty first dates. Don't get to fancy, either. A walk, bike ride, or other mostly-unstructured activity where you can chat is a great idea. Why unstructured? If there's no spark, you don't have to suffer through the rest of the dinner/day/activity. You can just laugh it off, realize there's no connection, and go home. 

That's about it. I'm happy to give more advice (hah) if you ask for it. For some info: I'm a 26 year old super geeky lady. I started a soft-circuit company, teach electronics, and am learning programming. I am also a cartoonist and a trekkie. 

TL;DR:

1. don't act like a troll

2. forever alone attitude is unsexy

3. laugh it off

4. expectations get you in trouble

Some photographic proof:  http://imgur.com/MHqlf

Edit:  Thanks for all your amazing comments.  They mean a lot!  I am starting to rethink the tattoo idea just because I'm still losing!  I just feel like I need to commemorate this amazing milestone!  Any ideas?

Edit:  Hey guys, thanks for all the amazing comments.  I'm getting a lot of questions and I'll try and answer some.

How I did it:  Initially when I was really overweight, I just did cardio and limited my caloric intake. This was good for dropping weight fast. However, I realize that it isn't the proper way to do it. I did a ridiculous amount of research and currently I go to the gym three times a week where I do 30 mins of cardio(elliptical); 45 mins of weight training and then 20 minutes of stretching. I've discovered weight training is key, it increases your metabolism and you continue to burn calories for 24 hours after. I make healthier food choices but I don't completely restrict myself. I don't kill myself because I had a bad weekend. Just get back on the horse and continue. I've gotten to a point where I feel crappy if I haven't been to the gym in a few days, it limbers you up and makes you feel good. 

Maintaining: since I'm still losing, I'm not in the maintaining stage yet.  Some days are worse than others and I just want something deliciously bad for me and some days I have to drag my ass out of bed.

How I ended up so big:  I had dropped out of University and was working as a manager at Mcdonalds (constitutes free food) and even though the job was physically demanding, I did nothing at home, zero exercise and over ate like no one's business.  Looking back at it, I don't how I let myself get that big.  I blame depression mostly.

No surgery!  All hard work.

If anyone has some good links on training diets, I would appreciate it.  I'm looking to take it to the next level.

37616,"I never really have anyone I can talk to, so I'm settling for blindly reaching out for advice on the 'webz.

Life has been really rough for the past few years. Everyone tells me ""things will get better"", but I don't really believe anymore - I mean, it's been 3 years since I can remember being really happy. And that's making things really hard.

If I try to explain everything that's been building up, no one will actually take the time to read this. So, to sum it up - 

My dad is not the person I grew up thinking he was. He is my boss at work. He is a liar. Recently, I found out he cheated on my mom with my friend/coworker 4 years ago (I have not shared this information with my mom). He was sending her angsty love-emails as of 2 years ago, after she left him. Bondage was involved. Some pictures suck to find. He has run the company nearly into the ground. He owes me thousands of dollars in back-payroll. He constantly makes commitments he can't follow through on. He has broken many promises to me, and continues do so on a weekly, if not daily, basis.

My mom has the only real income in their household. She has medical issues that leave her in pain. 

My sister (early 20's) is crazy and hates me. She will never be able to hold down a job, and will probably always live with my parents.

My parents house was foreclosed on this month. We don't know how long they have to stay there. The house has been more or less destroyed by neglect and animals that weren't house trained. It is disgusting.

I live by myself. I have a dog. I had a car, but my dad couldn't pay me my paychecks, so I wasn't able to keep it maintained properly. The engine seized last month. It is still being paid off, which I planned to do 9 months or so ago, to keep from getting hit by the horrible interest rate. My dad promised many times to help me with that.

I'm still crazy about my long distance ex, but try really hard to bury that feeling, because there's nothing I can do about it. He is still one of the only positive things in my life- I can't tell him about everything going on (you know, like, missing him 3 years after we broke up), but he listens to everything I can. He tells me to ""follow my heart"". That always makes me do one of those sad ""laugh because it hurts"" things.

So maybe the world isn't actually asploding. It's more falling apart bit by bit. This is a summery of the main stuff - it excludes things like, my two best friends stabbing me in the back 4 years ago, my dark teenage years... Many other things.

I was a very sweet, happy, optimistic person. People used to want to be around me. I just can't be anymore. 

And I know this is stupid to be writing. Blah blah, poor me. Suck it up and get over it, right? I've written this kind of crap a half dozen times over the past few months, but never posted it. I don't know what I expect to happen - maybe nothing. I'm just not able to cope with things sometimes, and I have no one to talk to - my latest best friends were also my sister's friends. Now they're her best friends (because it really makes a difference to her, for them to be there, according to my mom), and they don't bother calling me anymore, and blew off all my invites to hang out.

Anyway, sorry for the self-pity or whatever. I just need to feel like I'm not alone for a bit.",1,-1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-1,-1,-1,0,-1,-1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-1,-1,-1,0,-1,-1,0

(It seems kind of bland anyway, so I probably wouldn't want to do that either way)

So I'm looking for something replace Flotilla. Ideally, the game I want to play would be like a space version of the game [""Sid Meier's Pirates""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sid_Meier%27s_Pirates!_%282004_video_game%29). I loved that game. I liked buying ships to add to my fleet and going around and selling cargo and fucking up pirates and stuff. That's basically what I'm looking for.

I've really liked Sins of a Solar Empire too. Again, I liked being able to buy ships and create massive fleets. It's not really the kind of game I'm looking for right now though. You know, it's all RTS-y all the time, and you have to defeat the enemy to win. I want a bit more openness to it.

Edit: I guess it was naive of me to assume all of you know anything about macroeconomics. Here's what I know, correct me if I am wrong:

The federal reserve controls interest rates. This is not because that power is bestowed upon them, it is just the product of hundreds of years of evolution of market systems. Interest rates are what shape the decisions of every single company involved in any type of finance. Interest rates affect every person's life, whether you know it or not. 

If anyone were to know anything about what the federal reserve is up to, ie what their target interest rate is, they would have a HUGE edge over everyone else.

If EVERYONE knew what the fed was up to, demand for loans would either drop to 0 until that new interest rate was put into place, or the supply of loans would drop to 0 until the new interest rate was put into place. This would send the loanable funds market into a shitstorm of collapse, and the economy would basically end.

39326,"Lately there has been some ballyhoo about the particulars of ""downvoting stuff you disagree with"". Some suggestions for consideration:

* **Don't upvote just because you ""agree"", either. Use the same standards for upvoting that you do for downvoting: does this add to the discussion? Is it smart, new, thought-provoking, interesting, entertaining, informative? Reckless upvoting is just as circle-jerky as knee-jerk downvoting is.**

* Reddiquette is not official policy or rules or terms of service. It's suggestions on how to make reddit a better place, written by users. 

* Downvotes can and should be used be used as a democratic ""ban"" on bad content, and content that detracts from or fails to add value to a discussion. 

* There is no reason not to downvote content or comments that are dishonest, misleading, or factually wrong. Redditors should feel free to exercise reasonable judgement as to whether something ""adds to the discussion"". 

* Sometimes even mistaken or wrongheaded comments can and do add to the discussion and quality of reddit by offering thoughtful and/or substantive articulations of common misconceptions. Responding to those posts with high-quality rebuttals is better than downvoting them, both because it generally increases the quality of the discussion, and because it helps prevent having dozens or hundreds of sub-threads all hashing out the same arguments. 

* Stupid or counter-productive comments are just as bad as, if not worse than, ""wrong"" arguments, even if they are ""on the right side"". They should be downvoted, even if they come from ""your team"", for the same reasons as above. They pollute, rather than add to the discussion. 

* **Try to apply the same up/downvote standards to both submissions AND comments.** Be sure to upvote good submissions, not just good comments, and DON'T upvote low-quality submissions just because they are about pot or wikileaks or making fun of christians or sticking it to feminists or whatever. Not everything you agree with improves the quality of reddit. 

* Consider making heavy use of the ""non-vote"" option, especially for submissions/comments that you have not actually read or understood. Allow redditors with the time to read them to moderate the content that you're just skimming. 

* Long posts may have a lot of points, some good, some bad. Vote with care, and consider a reply if it is more appropriate than a downvote ""ban"".

* Occasionally, you will find yourself upvoting a comment or article, and then reading a comment that appears to successfully rebut it. Consider letting the original upvote stand, and then upvoting the rebuttal, as well. Sometimes the best content is rigorous debate, and if you were persuaded by one good argument, and then persuaded by an even better counter-argument, then *both* of those might actually be helping to make reddit better. 

**Use your reddit powers for good, to help make reddit the best place to find good-quality content online.** Upvote stuff that is thought-provoking, intelligent, new, interesting, informative, and entertaining. Downvote stuff that is dumb, circle-jerky, tedious, misleading, badly-sourced, spammy, or repetitive. Imagine that you are the editor-in-chief of the entire internet, and that each upvote means ""this makes it to the internet"" and that each downvote means, ""this is trash and should be excluded from the internet"". Consider yourself as having a certain amount of journalistic responsibility to use your powers judiciously-- not to dictate what people should see and think, but to make sure that the best-quality stuff is put out there for consideration.

39510,"Lots of guys here have problems due to simply being scared to talk to girls. I have no issue like that. Others don't know what to say. Others still have other confidence issues. My problem is pretty strange, to say the least.

Basically, I have to not be thinking about the girl in a romantic way at all for me to even talk to her. If I know I'm trying to flirt with her, I'm thinking to myself 'what an idiot, you're so fake/showing off'. I can't stand people showing off, so it's like I see that in myself and put myself off. I feel like I'm just doing the peacock thing and showing my feathers and it makes me feel sick. I don't like to make myself look impressive at all! So anything remotely resembling mindless, generic small talk ruins it for me. 

So the only successful times I've had with girls romantically have been when she's initiated it (taking the pressure off me to try and 'look impressive' - I know I shouldn't be doing this anyway), or when the conversation has just started naturally, and it's only after a minute or two that I realise I like her. 

So you could call it 'humbleness complex', where I refuse to acknowledge things I'm good at, making me seem pretty dull, I suppose. And it's worse than that; I sort of repress the fact that I like particular girls due to my own self-doubt. It actually makes them less attractive when I'm thinking 'fat chance' and so on.

How on earth do I get out of this pickle? I have a feeling that 'just believe in yourself' will do nothing, I have to do something. The worrying thing is, if I got very good at something, I would still not feel any better about myself (e.g. I know my music skills are very good given the time I've been learning, I know I'm fairly good-looking, I have many really positive qualities, my female friends are nonplussed that I do so badly with girls, but it doesn't change my perception that I don't deserve romantic relationships, somehow)

So I'm at the bar with some friends and this woman I've been flirting with for a couple weeks (I don't see her very often) comes in with her friends. We chat for a couple minutes as we're getting beers, but always part back our groups. Finally around 11 p.m. all of my friends leave. It's a non-smoking bar so I step outside to have a cigarette. As I come back in she, we'll call her A, asks, ""Do you want to go for a smoke?""

In that second I hear the voice of David Wygant say, ""You have to make moments.""

me: I just had a smoke...

A: Oh (disappointed)

me: But I 've got some bud and I know a concealed area out back if you want to smoke. (Look at my name, what you do expect)

A: Really? lets go.

So we go out back and toke up. We're flirting back and forth with mutual Kino going on. We go back out front and have a cigarette and one of her friends, we'll call her B, grabs A's arm and says, ""We need to go.""

A: But I'm talking to [me]

B: No we need to go now

A: Sorry [me] I guess I have to go

This was about 12:30 a.m.

I give her a little pat and said I'd get in touch with her.

So I wake up this morning and there's a text message waiting for me from A saying, ""Sorry I had to leave, B saw the guy I've been going out with making out with my best friend.""

me: No problem and that's fucked up. You shouldn't have to worry about your boyfriend and best friend going at each other

A: Oh he's not my boyfriend, I actually don't even like him that much so I'm not worried about it. We'll have to get together soon and swap bud

me: You doing anything tonight

A: I'm going to [local ski resort] with some friends, but if we're back not too late I'll let you know

me: sounds good

40899,"Hi guys - I've recently discovered Fitit (having only recently discovered Reddit too), and I am genuinely amazed at the wealth of useful information here relating to fitness/weight loss/weight training etc etc. 

I've been generally reading around, and I've taken a look at the FAQ and some related links, however I've a couple of questions, if anyone would be able to take the time to help me out a bit!

**Some Background**

I have, in the past, been able to keep up a fairly basic workout schedule, which had little structure, and consisted of something along the lines of:

- 10-20 minutes cardio
- Doing particular muscle groups, with little regularity as to which ones were done on specific days

This yielded some results, however I'm now looking to go for something which is a bit more effective.

**Now - the questions:**

*Cardio*

It seems that a fair few programs are based on about 3 lifting-based workouts a week, on non-consecutive days. However, how does this tie into cardio? Is it acceptable to, for example, do 30/40 minutes of cardio in the days inbetween? The reason I ask, is because I would not only like to achieve a low body fat percentage (and I realise that weights will burn a lot of calories and help with this), but eventually, would also like to be able to increase my endurance somewhat. 

*Types of programs to follow*

From what I've read, it seems that Mark Rippletoe's Starting Strength is often recommended as a great beginner program. However, looking at the JohnStoneFitness site (linked as a great transformation in the FAQ), it seems that his initial workouts were more based upon different, non-compound lifts on non-consecutive days, with cardio in the days inbetween? I guess this ties into my above question, but is either of these ways particularly better than the other?

That's pretty much all I've got to ask, at the moment. Apologies if I'm failing miserably at understanding all of this, although I'd hugely appreciate it if someone could clear up any misconceptions I have so far :D

Thanks in advance, Fitit!

There is at least an albums worth of photos, and money for this is not limitless, the photos range in age from the 1990s to World War II, maybe some older, maybe some younger, as far as I know they would all qualify as being in good condition. The age and possible fragility of these images has me leaning away from doing it myself/ourself to a professional who would know what there doing. So am wondering if anyone 1) has any experience with this ? 2) Can anyone recommend a reputable person/business/service in the Metro or Tigard/Sherwood areas ? I'm trying to avoid having to mail these out somewhere.

44638,"The apartment complex I currently live in is really big on energy conservation. Super insulated units, all halogen lights, high efficiency washer/driers, low gallon-per-flush toilets, etc... 

This is great in theory, however - the toilets are complete crap. The restricted flow rate is accomplished by some kind of bucket in the toilet tank that severely restricts how much water can actually go down the flapper. 

The end result is every time I pee, I flush the toilet 3-4 times. Every time I poop, it's 5-6 flushes. This winds up not only pissing me off, but wasting far more water than if the damn toilet just worked properly to begin with. I asked at Lowe's and they told me that the bucket thing is pretty much built in, and I would have to replace the toilet to fix the problem. I can't replace the toilet because I'm renting. 

The first flush will only move maybe 1/2 of the fecal matter down the pipe, and the rest backflows into the bowl. I think it is something like 0.6 or 0.8 gallons per flush. It is a stupid fucking idea, and I wind up having to use so much more water just to flush away one bowel movement. 

I don't really have a point, I just am beyond irritated with having to plunge it yet again today and wanted to vent. Very low volume toilets are CRAP.

We took another bus, this time number 72, to an art museum/shopping center.  We went to a fancy Chinese restaurant, and set up the crib at our table to put the baby in.  It was at that point that we realized that the baby was yet unnamed.  The only conclusion that my roommate and her male friend came to was that the baby could not be named Mary.

45786,"Hey,

I'm from Canada (Toronto) and I'm thinking about going to California for the first time. SF/Bay Area looks like the place for me (LA not so much). Only US city I've been to NYC, plus a few other eastern cities in Canada, but I've never been to the west coast, or anywhere remotely ""warm"".

I've read [a few threads](http://www.google.com/search?q=site:reddit.com+inurl:bayarea+OR+inurl:sanfranciso+OR+inurl:sanjose+OR+inurl:oakland+visiting) already and checked out Tripadvisor and Wikitravel.  Still looking for some advice though.

* Planning for something between Sat Jan 1 - Fri Jan 7, but I'm pretty flexible. I don't really know whether to stay 1, 2 or 6 days. Trying to find the right balance. What's this time of year like there?

* I don't drive, my entire trip will be on public transit. I hear you guys have decent transit.

* Travelling alone. (Wouldn't mind meeting someone for a beer or two.)

* I try to see pro sports teams when I travel. Hockey is my thing. I really want to go to a Sharks game (they play Vancouver on Mon Jan 3, Buffalo on Thu Jan 6, Nashville on Sat Jan 8). But SJ is quite a ways away from SF, and I'm not sure how long I should stay there. 

* My thought is to plan my trip around the game, where I'd stay in SJ for one night near the end of the trip and fly home out of there. I don't think it'd be worth it to stay in SF and take the 2h+ train there and back (but maybe I'm wrong).

* Most of the things I've read are about SF. What other parts of the Bay Area should I visit, keeping in mind that I won't have access to a car. Would it be worth it to try something where I start in SF, and ride CalTrain south, and get off occassionaly? 

* Worth it to stop and/or stay nights in Palo Alto, Mountain View, Santa Clara, etc? (I've never been to a US college campus, maybe I'd check out Stanford.) Or should I stay in one place and make day trips out of this?

* I probably have a misconceived view of this, but I'd like to see ""Silicon Valley"", whatever that means. The [Computer History Museum](http://www.computerhistory.org/hours/) is unfortunately closed for renovation until Jan 13. Is there anything else touristy like this for a techy? Is this museum so amazing that I should postpone my trip for a week to see it?

* I will tolerate museums and sightseeing tours when I'm playing tourist, but after the first day or two I really prefer to wander around, explore, ride the subway, get good food, coffee, beer, etc.

* I prefer the city, but I'd be a bit disappointed if I didn't get outdoors-natural-type sightseeing while on the west cost. I was looking at Tripadvisor, thinking about getting one of the shuttle/tours to Muir Woods.

* I like to bike (credentials: I commute to work, and I rode through Manhattan as a tourist and didn't die), and hear it's awesome in the SF area, but NYC/Toronto is flat and the hills will likely kill me. Also, the weather in January might not be the best. Should I still try anyway? Any of the other Bay Area cities besides SF amenable to biking in January?

So, any ideas, suggestions, thoughts... all very welcome.

**edit:** Thanks for the response.

Normally I wouldn't make a complaint, however he just had a second bone-marrow transplant this past summer for leukemia and is now recovering from a serious mold infection and pneumonia that almost killed him in October.

46866,"The iconomy is a powerful mod that introduces a trading system onto the server, so here is a quick tutorial on how to get the basics of it. Basic commands will be in **bold**, and examples in *italics*, same as in the chest locking tutorial.

Lev has already created a wonderful tutorial on shops and signs, so I won’t go into that. It can be found right here: http://www.reddit.com/r/MCNSA/comments/eg2f6/iconomy_sign_shop_tutorial/

Now, before you get into creating a shop, it is important to understand the system. The first command to know, **/money**, will tell you your balance in the currency of the server ‘caps’. You can also use it to find out how much money others have, such as */money Enou*, or see who the richest of the server are, using */money top*, and see where you or others stand with */money rank*, or */money rank enou*.  The **/money** command can also be used to transfer money to other players. Example: */money pay enou 350* This can be used in trusted trades, or for gifts.  You can view these commands at **/money ?**

The **/shop** commands allow you to interact with the server and it’s goods, rather than buying from player-owned shops. Things are generally more expensive from the server, for example, buying a diamond costs 200 caps, and you only get 100 for selling one!

 To find out both the buying and selling price of an item, you use the command **/shop &lt;item id&gt;**. So for diamonds I would say */shop 264* and the server would inform me of the prices. The mod also recognizes some aliases for some items, so */shop diamond* would work. If you wanted to know the cost of 5 diamonds, you can use **/shop &lt;item id&gt; &lt;amount&gt;**, so */shop 264 5* in this case. It’s important to note that some items can only be bought and sold in stacks of 64. 

Now in order to buy a an object, you use **/shop buy &lt;item id&gt;**, so for a diamond */shop buy 264*. If the item is only sold in stacks, it will mean you get 64 of them. If you want to buy more than one of an item or more than one stack, use **/shop buy &lt;amount&gt; &lt;itemid&gt;**, so for 5 diamonds  */shop buy 264 5*. 

Selling items to the server works the same way, using **/shop sell &lt;item id&gt;** for one of the item and **/shop sell &lt;amount&gt; &lt;item id&gt;** for multiple. Example: */shop sell 264* and */shop sell 264 5*. 

You can also take advantage of **/shop list &lt;buy&gt; &lt;page#&gt;** or **/shop list &lt;sell&gt; &lt;page#&gt;**  to see what is for sale or what you can sell. For example:  */shop list sell 2* or */shop list buy 5*. You can review all of these commands at **/shop ?**

As for **/lottery**, well, I can’t help you much there, and the system has not yet been calibrated by Nsan. However, the one command is **/lottery**, which buys you a ticket for a set (and unknown by me) cost, and that is immediately shown to win or lose a variable item, *not* caps, which should be different each time you win. However, this has not been tweaked yet, so Nsanidy has asked that we do not use it. 

Happy shopping =)

Granted, I am a straight, middle aged, middle class, white, Christian, libertarian, married, parent of 4, with a full time job so my kind are the cause of everything that is wrong with the world,  Never mind that I didn't choose to be born a straight white male into a middle class American family.

However, it matters not, what the subject of the thread is:

Posted a pic: fake, shopped, oh here is the original, lame, stupid

You follow a Facebook meme: you are a Slacktivist, certainly awareness means nothing

You donate $ to something: why you making the rest of us feel like crap?

Your are a Republican: you are a racist ashhole who wants everyone but white middle class men to die.

You are a Democrat: you are a socialist elitest who wants the middle class to die and the poor to live off the backs of the rich

You have a religion: you are a fool who believes in fairy tales and should die cause you are stupid.

You are a libertarian: You are the worst because you are an anarchist who wants no government and things everyone should just run around willy nilly

You are an atheist: You are an immoral moron who couldn't possibly do any good in the world.

You are married: you are an idot.  Life is short- screw anyone you can.

You are single: you are obviously a slut who is afraid of commitment

You are &lt;18: get off Reddit you are too young

You are 18-35: great, the slacker generation who has no sense or work ethic and has everything handed to them

You are 35-50: The ultimate lazy generation.  No ambition, you are all goth or emo and should just commit suicide

You are 50-60: Babyboomers, you just plain ruined the world for us.

You are &gt;60: WTF are you doing on Reddit, you can't even use a computer!

You are straight: you are a homophobe who couldn't possibly have a decent bone in your body.

You are gay: You are the cause of all evil in the world

You are Christian: Oh wait, you are the cause of all evil in the world.

Reddit is anti-everything and puts stereotypes on everything!  

But its like a trainwreck, I keep coming back and reading more and more; even if it does piss me off and make me feel like shit.

I need serious help!

Edit: Added a comma as I clearly was not a married parent of 4 in the womb as interesting as that could be.  Fixed fairy tails to tales.  Believing in fairy tails is probably not a widely recognized religion.  Also clarified the what I couldn't choose to be born as.  I'm not stupid enough to think I was born Libertarian or Christian.  

Additional Comment: Notice Barney21 uses sarcasm to make a valid and funny point about a grammatical error.  On the other hand, ChaosBeast is clearly one of the aforementioned assholes who feels he needs to be be obnoxious bastard who tears someone down and assumes they don't take responsibility for themself.

Having watched plenty of porn, I have to ask whether or not this is normal. First, I've never seen anywhere near that level of hardness in a porn. Second, I've seen many positions which require the penis to bend a bit; even getting to 90 degrees is a bit of a stretch for me, it starts to hurt.

I've only had a little bit of sex, and it's been a while; it was never a problem then, but we never really left the missionary position, which doesn't require much of an angle there.

48424,"Hey reddit. I never thought I would be posting here, but look at me now.
I'm a 16 year old Canadian male, and quite frankly, there's no place for me in the world.

Everyone in life has a passion, something they like, something they enjoy. And then everyone has a job, which they enjoy to some degree aswell. and if not, a dream job. Everyone has something to look forward to.

Not me. I don't have anything I'm passionate about, or feel that I could be passionate about. They always ask me if I want to play hockey, go skiing, watch a movie, and I always refuse. People ask me what I do after school when I get home and I cant really answer that. I come home, and read or go on reddit or other media sites. I do this for lack of anything better to do. I also go on long, long walks down the endless roads of cornfields I live by. I program small things because it's purely logical thinking, and keeps my mind busy. I can only program things that have already been done, because I don't have an original thought in my head.

I've always been like this, since I was a kid and everyone asked me what I wanted to be when I grew up, I've always told them I didn't know. You know when you're 5 years old and you wanted to be a firefighter? I never had that.

I can't see myself anywhere in the future. People can always atleast think of a category of somewhere to get into (ex business, mechanics, etc). I can't. I honestly can't. Not even a job where I can think ""hey, I could do that I guess"", there's nothing I can think of at all.

That's where my parents come in. My dad is no longer going to pay for college or university because of my indecisiveness. I'm not too hurt by it, because I didn't know what I was going to go to college for for anyway. I guess it just cuts off another road I could have taken. 

My best friend (before he died of a blood clot in his brain during the summer) said that I was still young, and that there was still hope for me. I somehow doubt there's something I'm not seeing.

I don't fit anywhere, and that's where I stand.

I am a 22 year old male. I've been fortunate enough to have a family that is upper-middle class, and that supports me no matter what. I was given the choice of going to college anywhere in the world and I chose the US over any other place because I truly believe is has the best university system in the world and its universities are among the most recognized in any field. Since my family owns a business of warehouses and distribution I didn't want to go that  far off the field so I chose to become a finance major. I'm a senior now and I can't say I don't like my major but it is not what I really am excited about, I've found that the entrepreneurship aspect of it is one of the parts that moves me. The internet is the other thing that love. I've always loved computers but I wasn't smart enough to become a programmer (hate algebra and calculus, like the coding languages aspects of it, though).

Well long story short I wanted to know what are the steps to become a decent webmaster, I want to know all about website creation, maintenance as well as search engine marketing and optimization. I'm kind of looking for like online classes because I don't live in a major city (tiny college town) or something along those lines. I've already done some research in my university, and all they offer is a frontpage course, which I don't think will do for what I want. I want to be able to make professional grade website, possibly a store or even just an articles site that profits from ads who knows. The thing is that I want to get into this field. 

So now I'm one semester shy of graduating and I want to learn everything I can before May that my student visa expires and I have to leave.

then she got a calling to primary in the ward she was baptized.  she was really upset by this, because she had no friends at this ward and her family didn't like her being a mormon.  going to the ward 45 minutes away was a perfect solution.  she got to go to church with her friends and her parents/grandparents couldn't bug her on sunday because she was out of town.  also, her friends usually went home on saturday afternoon, did fun stuff saturday night and then carpooled to church together.  so, she had grown accustomed to spending the night with her friends' families, and the families all really enjoyed having her as a guest.  

after a few months of her having this calling, she started going back to her friends' ward, and only going to her calling once a month or so.  when a temple baptism trip came up, she was denied a recommend because of her failing to take her calling seriously.    

she was devastated by this.  it was the first chance she had to go to the temple and there wouldn't be another one for months.  the bishop of the ward she liked going to said he would try to get her a transfer, as they needed another primary teacher anyway.  our bishop wouldn't have it.  he told her that he refused to transfer her membership because she needed to learn to respect her duties to the church. 

when i found all this out, it punched me in the gut pretty hard.  before i was a mormon, i had been to, literally hundreds of, other churches/synagogues, and none of them had anything like this.  the baptists at my school that i had gone to church with a few times could go to any damn baptist church they wanted and not get any flack.  hell, they could go to churches of other denominations and be alright.  

people always want to know THE reason i left the church.  the truth is, there isn't one big reason.  there are hundreds of little ones.

Now, I agree with the fact that girls are being sexualized and put into groups at younger ages, and it probably has an influence on what kind of people they will grow up to be.

But as far as girls being bullied more? I don't feel like this is anything new. Think about it, its not special. If a boy ever brought a doll to school, you bet your tits he'd get his ass beat. The reason there are more instances of girls getting made fun of for having ""boyish"" things/clothes, is because its becoming more acceptable in the household to allow them to discover their interests despite gender. And these girls are bringing it to school, because they've been taught it is okay at home. Ten years ago, girls were always told that they were to play with dolls, and the cars were for their brothers. That was how it was, and that was how they grew up.

Now, I'm not saying that we should all make sure our girls wear frilly dresses and play Barbie (Lord knows I loved Legos and video games when I was a little girl. It probably explains why I get along better with guys, even to this day.) I'm just saying that the whole bullying thing is being blown out of proportion.

51223,"Hello all redditors and passing by readers:)

We are all I think are up to date about wikileaks, about all those documents being published. It's all over the internet,  news - everywhere.

I read some of the stuff wikileaks published in details, but since there are SO MANY of those things to go through, I pick up only ones which are interesting for me personally (about the country I live in..or smth like that).
I guess in those ""cables"" - almost everyone can find something ""interesting"" about the place and government where they live.

BUT

Here is a question which is now growing more and more in my head…

There were ton's of reactions from the media, many many people support wikileaks, many hate. Published documents vary from bizarre government ""crimes"" to insignificant mischief:)) 

BUT = WHAT'S NEXT? 

If there is a proof (which has to be checked of course and double checked and so on…but at least there is a ""direction"" in which to look for the truth) - where is justice? Who will take this information which wikileaks provides and DO SMTH with it to - punish those who are guilty or honor those who are innocent…

Cause if things will go on like they are now….soon - wikileaks won't matter anymore. We will all know that it's a website which posts truth which is too ""big"" and scary to be used for bringing justice. And it may just fade into the void where it keeps on fighting against a huge, brick wall with bare hands...

So, what you think, will those materials lead to something different then only the increase of security in governments? Will wikileaks be able to really change things they are or this media boom will just fade out with time?

P.s. I'd like to clarify, that I'm not looking into bringing one specific country to pay for smth it did wrong:) I was born in one country, now I live in another - and I saw some stuff about both of the governments behaving inhuman, cowardly, ruining lives of many (or helping others with doing so). And I don't feel pity for them if they are brought to justice one day and it makes no difference if this is my motherland or not. I don't want to be a part of the country which can kill others for nothing or for ""my well being"" as they say. 

If I knew how much will be stolen or how many will be killed after I vote for a guy - I might not vote for him.

I understand that Wikileaks aims for transparancy in the government, and it's great that they're releasing all this information that allows us to see what the government is really up to. But this release of key national security targets might not be the best idea; it's giving terrorists an idea of where to strike because now they know exactly what would hurt the US. 

I'm not saying Wikileaks is a bad thing, I think it's great. So don't kill me on this opinion. However, I thought they would be releasing information that would not directly harm anyone. This sounds like it might just do that.

51373,"So I was lucky enough to procure a handful of bottles, and I'm drinking one right now (in a Chimay glass... it's the closest thing I have that is similar in size and shape to an Orval glass), and really enjoying the bitter, citrus-like flavour.

It seems to get a bad rap for the most part, though (BeerAdvocate ratings aside).  It's usually either not mentioned when people discuss Trappist ales (It's always, Rochefort, and Westvleteren--still haven't had a chance to try this, but so badly want to-- being praised, with Westmalle being a close second, Chimay being snubbed for ""selling out"", and Achel being completely forgotten--for good reasons, let's admit it, their offerings are mostly average-- and La Trappe (Koningshoeven) being ignored, due to it not being a Belgian trappist--but the tripel is simply amazing on tap, and quadrupel almost as awesome from corked bottles).

Even the Wikipedia entry seems to poke fun at it, and I quote:

* Orval Trappist Ale, 6.2% ABV, often referred to as The Queen of Trappists. It was first made in 1931, and has a complex and unusual flavor and aroma produced by a unique strain of yeast. The beer is light in color, slightly cloudy, and has a large, foamy head. There is a **complex aroma of leather, horse blanket**, spice, and many other earthy components.

Emphasis mine.

To be fair, they could be right, as I've never drank leather or horse blankets (Except for that one expired tetra pack of Campbell's beef broth.  Perhaps that's a story for some other time), but let's be honest, if you're out to try a new beer, this sort of description would probably not sway it in your favour.

In my opinion, it's, as I've mentioned, very citrus-like, with a bitter, perhaps slightly chalky aftertaste (damn, that doesn't sound as appealing either, does it?).  The citrus is what lingers the most, however, and it's quite pleasant.  It almost reminds me of non-fruit infused lambics... perhaps even a flemish red, but without the complexity or sour notes.

51546,"We have a [neutered male] 15-month-old cat and two [neutered male] six-month-old kittens (littermates). We are also currently fostering two [10-week-old Russian Blue/DSH mix kittens](http://imgur.com/aezoK), who are females and are littermates, as well. As you can imagine, with so many young kitties, things are a bit hectic. They all get along very well and are very affectionate with us and with each other, but they are also all mischievous. We don't really mind the rampant destruction, as we intentionally buy either tough/washable or totally disposable furniture. We look past the foster kittens' occasional litterbox mishaps- they are very little, and were separated from their mother, so our cats are teaching them, and they are doing very well. Still, we call the girls ""Stinky"" and ""Tinkles"" for obvious reasons.  

Before the foster kittens came along, our cats would sometimes make toilet paper nests, but it was not a frequent enough behavior to be cause for concern. We simply put the paper back on the roll and moved on with our day. Furthermore, the nests were never built far from their sources. Lately, we keep finding the litterboxes, which we keep in the den, living room, kitchen, and bedroom, filled with toilet paper/paper towel nests. It is really gross and difficult to clean these up, as the litterboxes are still, um, used after the nests are built. Has anyone else had this happen after introducing new cats, or could it be unrelated? We introduced slowly and properly, and have not observed any spats between any of the kitties. They groom each other, cuddle, and play. 

As a side note, if anyone in the the DC/VA/MD metro area is interested in adopting the girls, please PM me to set up a time to come see them. If you don't mind having to be a bit patient with them (they are no more taxing than any other kittens this age), they would be a great addition! They are very cat-friendly and are super-cuddly with people, as well. Sorry for the plug, but we are just having trouble finding an adopter to take both, and we'd prefer not to separate them.

Now, something that really bothers me is when it calls itself a 'Driving Simulator'. GT games are not driving simulators and if they were most people would not find them interesting to play.


Having played countless racing games, I favour particularly the GTR series (the first was the best imho), iRacing and rFactor. These games are true driving simulator with meaningful settings and accurate driver's input required. No question to play without force feedback wheel/pedals and shifter - and you would be greatly disadvantaged not to have a clutch pedal to match.


And there lies the problem for most gamers, these games are not intrinsically fun to play but aim at providing a realistic experience. At their first attempts, most players end up crashing in every single corners. Scoring decent lap times will require a huge amount of efforts, which will be too much for most.


[Top Gear recently put Greger Huttu, best iRacing driver who never drove a race car in his life, into a Star Mazda racer and he laped the track at less than 3s (1:24.8) below very solid times, the telemetry showing perfects braking points.](http://www.topgear.com/uk/photos/geek-rebooted-2010-11-26)

 
I challenge anybody playing GTs to come anywhere close to this, because the game doesn't allow for acquiring this kind of skills. GT5 is not a driving simulator.


**TL:DR. Played and enjoyed most GT games. If GT5 was a simulator, most people would not find it fun to play. GT5 is a great game but it is not a simulator.**

One of my friends and his girlfriend came over just as I was finishing a couple of Black Ops games. I figured while we were waiting for the other folks to show up and there were four us we'd have a private game or two on B.O's for a laugh, we load up split screen and set up a FFA match. My friend, is terrible at FPS's, he admits he is and we all know he is so he knows he is going to be terrible. His girlfriend however, had never even played on a 360 before let alone a FPS. The next ten minute game was possibly the funniest I have ever played, constant screaming and laughing from his girlfriend as she failed to hit anything. She could not fathom that there were two sticks for movement, let alone react in time to shoot at anything, she kept hip firing as she forget to use the sights and spent a lot of the game staring at either the sky or the ground. It was fantastic!
We played some combat training after where she managed to get 4 kills and was happy that she managed that.

And well... honestly guys, I must admit I still cling to the iPhone a bit. ""It's not that bad!"", said positive-me, after tons of things that annoy me to no end and *can't be fixed* by myself. I remember a comic with a comparison between iOS and Android - if it's a ""No"" on iOS, expect it to stay a ""no"" until... well, possibly forever.

List of things that are just WTF for me on iOS come a bit long, but recently I discovered that I can't actually set ""Auto-lock"" to ""Never"" if I have a Microsoft Exchange mail account (this one's from work) set-up! (google it and you'll understand) Jailbreaking it provides a solution which sadly does not work. And it goes on and on.

So to make the story short, I'm hooked. I've always wanted to try Android because I'm more of the Android mindset rather than iOS. However my iPhone was a birthday gift, so it was more of a given that I'd stay with it.

From what I've read, Google's got the Nexus S coming out soon. I'm hesitating a bit between Nexus S and Samsung Galaxy S.

* I heard Swype as input method is pretty good. Since it is something touted for the Galaxy S, getting the Nexus S would mean I won't be able to use Swype?
* The only objectively bad-enough point of the Nexus S I've seen is that it has got no miniSD slot. I think that's going to be fine with me, but how useful do you think the miniSD slot would be? Also, what are the main bad points of the Galaxy S that you know?
* Can you develop your own software with the SDK and just have it on your phone? (ie not developing to put it on the market but just copy it over to the phone) I assume this would be possible of course since if the phone is rooted, it would be just a matter of copying files over... but just to be sure there's no authentication/key-signing involved?

57517,"Me: 22 year-old male. Her: ex-girlfriend, dated for ~3 years, my first LTR.

We broke up about 6 months ago, and it wasn't pretty to say the least. Lots of problems brought on by poor communication on both our parts. She felt that life had stagnated and she wanted to have fun while I wanted to ""settle down"" (not the case, but far be it from me to convince her otherwise at the time). We had a pretty ugly fight, the mother of all fights, and that was that. She clearly did want a change of pace as her and her friend packed up and moved to a city 8 hours away from her friends and family. We remained incommunicado for several months (before she left, I feel she played with my heart a little, which made me pretty bitter)

I was a wreck for a while. Went on a bender or four, had some wild nights, and took comfort in my friends. All in all, it was good fun and let me blow off a lot of steam but I'm now settled into a good job, a new apartment, and life on my own. I'm past the stage of looking for random hookups and I'm seeking a more meaningful relationship, but haven't found much luck, leaving me feeling a little lonely and hopeless.

Enter about 3 weeks ago. She IMs me on Facebook to catch up. We talked online for hours. It took me forever to get over this girl, and that conversation reminded me of why I loved her so much. It lit another fire under my heart, leaving me with this odd mixture of longing, confusion, and apprehension. She opened up to me about how hard it's been for her looking for steady work, making friends, etc. I related, yet felt incredibly uncomfortable when she mentioned guys, who just wound up treating her like shit. We talked kinda sporadically, her contacting me each time, and her always wanting to continue the conversation.

On Saturday, I was out in the city with some friends, when I get a series of (clearly drunk) texts from her, the gist of it being that she felt horrible that she threw away our relationship over some things that could have been solved, that I'm the only guy that's ever treated her even halfway decently, and that she's an idiot. Yeah, it was a bit of an ego boost and made me feel a bit better about my own shortcomings that led to the demise of our relationship, but now I'm feeling more conflicted than ever... We spoke about it the next day, and though she was drunk when she wrote it, she meant every word, but was just too proud to admit it to me sooner.

My brain is mush right now. I wanted to move on, but now I feel oddly compelled to roll with this. I still do have feelings for her and this whole ordeal has had me doing a lot of reminiscing. I'm weighing in my head these opposing feelings of ""I'm still in love with her"" and ""she's an ex for a reason"", balanced with my own current feelings of loneliness... and I don't have a solid answer. She says there's a very good chance of her moving back home with her parents in the near future, bringing her back to being 30 minutes away. When we broke up, she was in a phase and I was in a funk. Heads seem to be clearer now, but I'm wondering if it's worth it to pursue rekindling our relationship.

I'm not usually one to come to the hivemind for advice of any sort, but I feel like I need to hear something from someone who's lived it, or can at least look at this objectively. My friends haven't been much help. A lot of them saw us as a ""perfect couple"", and were completely shocked when we broke up. I know a lot of ""forever aloners"" and those longing for lost love, and I know what their advice would be without even asking. My other friends are more of the ""disregard women, acquire currency"" type, and they're not much help either. I also find it hard to ask for advice of this nature to people personally close to me... guess that's why I'm on the internets asking strangers out of a sense of desperation.

I'm honestly not here looking for someone to say what I want to hear, because I have no clue what that is. Just looking for a little guidance from those who have loved and lost more times than I have. Am I just pining for something long-gone?

TL;DR: Broke up with ex of 3 years. 6 months later, she regrets it and is trying to reconnect. Don't know if I should pursue or not.",1,-1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It's not terribly loud but I can definitely tell it's happening. It's never been that noticeable in any previous car I've owned.

In a related issue, when driving in reverse at any speed, the shift back to drive (1) is fairly rough. This is only mitigated by going extremely slow in reverse, stopping, waiting several seconds and then shifting into drive.

It's still under factory warranty, so I want to get it corrected now, but I was just curious (from a technical standpoint) what might be going on with it.

57626,"I was playing a quick pub match (not enough time to get involved with my fellow redditors) and we were on defense on Isla Innocentes. 

There was a moment when the other team had planted a charge on the final box on the first stage. I ran over there, along with a couple teammates. I could see the recon who planted it run behind the the left side of the sheet-metal. I had a decision to make. I could try to chase after him, but there was no guaranteeing that my teammates would disarm the charge in the meantime. I decided that the two of them could handle one recon, and so I went for the disarm. Sure enough, right when my back was turned that same recon shot me in the back, fresh from murdering my two teammates. In the end, it was my fault for trusting them to accomplish their task. I should have gone for the disarm *and* predicted where the enemy would be.

Later, we were on the final stage. I hopped into the helicopter and a squadmate spawned on the gunner. I proceeded to circle-strafe the area as smoothly as physically possible for what seemed like ten minutes. Despite the fact that enemies were absolutely swarming the area, (I could see them on the radar) not once did my gunner make a kill. Eventually we got shot out of the sky. I parachuted to the ground, spun around and killed one of them. Then I looked on my radar and blind-sided two who were creeping around behind the tarp/fence around the helipad. Then I walked into the hangar and killed another one, when they planted the final charge. I sighed, and ran out of the hanger just in time to kill one of the enemies as they fled to cover before I was taken out. My teammates were not able to disarm.

Sometimes I feel like a mother hen just trying to get her chicks to not kill themselves. Why do pubbies seem to fail at even the most rudimentary tasks? It's like they don't even *want* to win...

57855,"Saturday night, I felt ready and vital.

All week I've been day gaming it. I know what confidence feels like. I've been dying to have a go at a party. I read a bunch of seddit and listened to some lectures. I look in the mirror and feel a strong attraction to myself as I finish my 2nd beer.

I'm going to a house party. I'll know 1/2 of the people there somehow. I know this is gonna be easy. I'm excited and confident.

I haven't looked this good in months. I've been doing yoga, broadening my shoulders, improving my posture. I've been growing out my hair, and it's a formidable black curly mane of power. My beard is full, my attire, mature. I am ready. I am vital.

It's cold as fuck outside! I catch a bus by standing with power, asserting with my pecks thrust forward that I need a ride. On the bus, as I round the corner I find an attractive girl making eye contact immediately. I glance away and sit across the aisle and a few seats back. All my preparedness is useless, I am not in state.

I wish the driver a good night and hop off the bus, my hair flying back in the cool breeze. I stop into the local beer distributor for a quart of yuengling and I walk towards the party, singing Peggy Sue. I feel like a man.

I find the house and there's a lone kid smoking on the porch. I bullshit with him, joking about smoking out in the cold. I tell him he's got passion.

I walk in, and down a long empty hall. I open a door and BAM, a room of people I don't know sitting on couches. I don't know what to say so I don't and walk through to the next room. Asian poker face. Not in state.

I felt smacked with relief when I see three good friends of mine and I start talking to them, pissed at myself for making an inconspicuous entrance.  An autistic kid finds me and starts talking enthusiastically and I respond in kind. You gotta be kind.

A train of hot girls burst in through the back door and I exclaim, ""Where the hell did you all come from? Some portal? What the hell is back there?"" It's a stupid question, there's a porch back there, but they laugh. It's not about what you say but how you say it. I turn back to my friends who are laughing and the girls head downstairs where live music is being played. 

I see some more old friends and shoot the shit but I get restless. It's time to head downstairs.

The music is dank. I see people I know all over the place. I greet everybody I know and head to where they are playing beer pong. Except it's strip beer pong and two girls I don't know have their pants and bra off. I quickly decided there was nothing reasonable I could say so I say whats up to the people I know in the room and leave. Gotta display some social proof before leaving.

I open up an HB7 and we have a boring conversation although she was into it. Still not in state, I saw the dance floor and realized the music was *amazing*. I ran in and started dancing like a crazy person. And then I snapped into state.

I was dancing by myself, totally into the moment, not thinking about dancing with any girls until I saw two HB5's laughing at me so I challenged them to the floor and we had a grand old time. I saw a HB6 I already knew and so I pivoted to her. And then it got kinda moshy next to me so I joined that. All that energy fueled the rest of my night.

So I see black and white stripped dress HB7.5 brunette. Damned cute. She's making eyes with me, close to the floor but not dancing. Of course, I asked her, ""What's wrong with you? Why aren't you dancing?"" I take her hand and whirl her around. I've been dancing for twenty minutes so I'm smooth now. I know to lead her, and so she follows. She tells me her name is Amanda. I tell her mine, hit eject, and join the semi-mosh.

Cut to five minutes later and an AFC is talking to Amanda. I'm sitting with a great buddy of mine and she makes eye contact. Now, I didn't think about it, I wink and look back to my friend laughing before I could see her reaction. ""I just winked at a girl and now I will never talk to her again because I just gave myself away."" He says, ""That's retarded,"" and I go, ""you're right,"" and walk up to her.

I have a prop I received earlier randomly, a pair of sunglasses. Wordlessly, I put them on her and say, ""Much better."" To the AFC I ask, ""Isn't she awesome?"" pointing to her shades. I leave, feeling like a douchebag. Would hate to be that AFC. Could have thought of something more worthwhile to say.

The rest of the night I'm bouncing around, talking to everyone, having a great time. And then Amanda comes over and we're talking isolated. I should have realized that I had her isolated but I didn't realize, drunk I suppose. And then she starts the job interview. Ugh, I wish I read about the job interview and the dangers of before that night, but I was an idiot and responded in kind and before I knew it I was in a boring, uninspired conversation. Lost all momentum. And worst I found myself lying to her about being in school because I didn't feel like talking about why I dropped out. Gross.

What I shoulda done is stopped the job interview short, pointed it out, and told her that if she wants to seduce me, she's gotta do better. I would then ""teach"" her to initiate kino to make me feel comfortable and you see where that is going. Biggest lesson learned.

All the other girls I was pursuing left during that conversation and I didn't have the heart to ask Amanda's #, knowing the pointless lies had built up upon themselves to the point where I knew the whole venture would be pointless. I left the party by myself.

TL;DR Had a good time, was life of party, but didn't kiss no girls.

Social Proof is king, easy at house parties. Dancing gives you energy builds social proof, confidence, state. Also great way to open and establish kino. Recognize the job interview, isolation. Don't lie.

Even so, I feel incredible sympathy for the Virgin Mary. Often she is depicted with a solemn look on her face in Byzantine icons, aware as she is of the impending death of her son. As a story, the Passion of the Christ touches me deeply because of scenes where Mary, distraught at the death of her son, cradles his body, flings herself against the cross, or weeps nearby as he suffers.  I'm asking specifically about Christian art because it seems like most of the atheists here are ex- or especially anti-Christian, though feel free to chime in on the art of other religions.

I understand it's all a numbers game and since I've only made a dozen or so attempts, it's not unreasonable to see them all end in rejection. But some of these girls expressed real interest in the first conversation, or so I thought, and then don't pick up when I call them.

My most recent failure (and the reason for this vent) comes from a girl who told me in class that we'd exchange information next class (which was today, and was also the last class) in order to study together for the final. She didn't even show up! I think she was the only one in the class missing, seriously. And this isn't the first time I've had weird reactions from girls. I had a girl in one class cut off our conversations by walking the other direction whenever we walked together after class.

58281,"Until about 6 months ago, I was one of those uneducated people who knew everything about drugs from D.A.R.E. and mandatory health classes (which from what I can tell give you just about as much accurate information on drugs as they do on sex). To put things in perspective, when a kid died in my school from a drug overdose I was told it was from pot and fully believed it.

Then I met my boyfriend, who smokes sometimes. He corrected a lot of my misconceptions, but he also suggested that I try smoking some myself for a multitude of reasons including chronic illness (which frequently prevents me from eating) and depression (which is already bad enough that I'm using over-the-counter antidepressants). 

I would love to try, but I'm absolutely scared shitless of getting caught. I also don't know quite what to expect - I've been high a few times on anesthesia/painkillers but my memories are muddled and I'm not at all sure how similar that is to being high from pot.

58331,"However, I have a few concerns.  


To start of, I'm currently a full time software developer in New York, and have been for a little over a year now.  I've already graduated with an undergraduate engineering degree from Cornell University.  I have a comfortable life here, but I really want to try out a country like New Zealand or Canada while I'm still young.  I don't mind taking a pay cut or doing another job, as long as I can still maintain a sustainable, fun lifestyle.


My main concern is the List of Occupations acceptable to be a Skilled Worker: http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/immigrate/skilled/apply-who-instructions.asp#list


I'm afraid that my year's worth or work will amount to nothing, because no variation of programmer exists on that list.  The closest is ""Professional Occupations in Business Services to Management"", but lets face it; That's a pretty big stretch.  I also read that Immigration really does not like IT workers using that occupation code.  Does this mean that I will have to reply on a job offer be able to migrate to Canada?


I noticed the ""C07.217 Computer and Information Systems Professionals"" occupation codes, but I don't know if that can actually help me. 


Thanks for all of your advice.  I appreciate it.

EDIT: Question 2;  Given my circumstance, am I better off:

 (A) quitting my job, going to Toronto for 6 months, and search for jobs while being unemployed.  Then applying for skilled worker immigration with a job offer in hand.  

OR 

 (B) searching for a job while still working in the US, and then move if/when I land something.  

B seems like the obvious answer, but if I stay here in the states, it will be difficult to attend any interviews.  Furthermore, If I search for jobs in Canada, while still maintaining my job in the States, then I will end up suddenly quitting on my employer, and that would be unfair to them.  Applying for work on a full time basis within Canada could possibly land me more and better options than whatever I might land on my spare time from working here in the States, through phone interviews.  On the other hand, being unemployed may give Canadian employers a bad impression.  Is there a drastic reason why I should do A over B, or B over A?  Thanks!

EDIT2: thanks to smacksaw's advice, I will not pursue either plan A nor plan B.  I am considering other countries as well.  I am perfectly willing to do graduate work in another country to gain citizenship there as well.  In fact, that was precisely my strategy for Japan.  However, I'll have to save for a while before I can really use that strategy.  If you could give me some first hand experience (or second hand, that's cool, too) with getting education to gain citizenship, then I'd really appreciate it.  Thanks!

58882,"Oh hai! Glad you decided to actually read this. I'm going to get straight to the point. Reading though a lot of the comments on the taxation posts today made me pretty pissed off and depressed. I feel like everyone (republicans and democrats) are ignoring the real problem.

Why isn't anyone asking about what our taxes are being spent on? The obvious answer is the liberal villain Defense Spending. You're absolutely right in 2009 it was $782 billion; it's the largest single expenditure in our government. I wholeheartedly believe we shouldn't be spending that much on defense alone. I also firmly believe that at some point defense spending will be drawn down over the next few years.

None of that is important when compared to the real problem of our entitlement programs. I'm sure you liberals just twitched thinking I'm going to rant about welfare but welfare is nothing compared to Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. In 2009 the federal government spent roughly $1.3 trillion between those three programs. That is 39% of the budget...

Think about that.

The crisis we're facing is simple to explain but incredibly complicated to fix. Those programs are growing faster than our economy because of our aging population. As our people retire the overall tax base shrinks as well. While retirement benefits are taxed the revenue generated is fixed at whatever the current tax rate is. Therefore the net effect is limiting growth in tax revenue.

Retirees are decreasing tax revenue while simultaneously increasing spending. This is horribly broken and is currently a crisis. While it's easy to blame corporations, the wealthy, or whatever other villain your imagination can conjure the real crisis we're facing is simply old people.

So my young liberal friends why aren't you angry about this crisis? Both parties are ignoring it yet know it's the single biggest problem our government faces. The popular meme is that we're taxing the poor to give the rich when in reality we're taxing the young to give to the old.

[Wikipedia breakdown of govt spending in 2009](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_federal_budget)

TL;DR Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid take up 39% of the Federal Budget in 2009 and will continue to grow as the baby boomers retire.

I'd like to start work on a larger project in the new year, preferably fiction. Do you guys have any tips on incorporating this type of work into larger pieces? Any guidance at all would be incredibly helpful as I start plotting my next project. 

If you'd like some samples of my writing styles, you can easily check out my blogs:

Unfortunately, the box on cataclysm states ""Requires TBC and Wrath to play"". Damn okay I think, no problem. So I bought all of them - Vanilla. TBC. Wrath. And cataclysm.

WoW vanilla installed fine. TBC installs fine.

Then I try to install WrathFT and instead of installing anything it says ""Downloading 7 gigs"". FT came with 2 discs and used neither of them to install.

Why does frozen throne have 2 discs if it uses neither?

Simple story. A friend of mine is at a cafe with friends, and the cute girl behind the counter is giving him some IOIs. So, after flirting with her a little, he goes up to the bar and asks to borrow a pen and paper. She gives it to him. He writes down his name and phone number and hands the paper back to her, saying ""Here. I'd really like it if you gave me a call."" with a big stupid grin on his face. Well, she loved it and got in touch with him later that same day. They went out the next day and he f-closed.

I'm just feeling a bit depressed and trying to keep motivation up. I did end up joining a medical trial with more traditional medicine after speaking with a fellow redditor via email for a while. I'm not in remission, but I've shown some halt to tumor growth, which is more than I had hoped. While this should be plenty to keep me going, my immune system has been compromised by the chemo. I get rashes, nasal infections, and feel like I have the flu most of the time -- all things that I was warned of. On the plus side, hair loss is a rarer side effect, vanity is grand. 

But, back to the mild depression/struggle for motivation. I find myself feeling quite lonely now. I don't feel like I have much to offer anyone, it takes all my energy to just keep going to work, and I feel very little accomplishment -- though I suppose I can see fighting this as a great accomplishment, it seems very personal and not to add much to the world.

Maybe I'm just tired. I've also been getting insomnia more and more. Ask me what you will. I'm too tired for taking advice though, no offense.

A woman calls me and starts trying to sell me a local newspaper.  I say: ""I'm not going to buy the newspaper.  I get all my news online.  Stop it."" and she keeps trying and then I say something like ""Look, I don't want to hang up on you, it feels kind of rude to me.  Just stop trying to sell me the newspaper.""

Then she just had this moment where she just laughed and gave up.  She asked: ""Where are you from exactly?"" and I say: ""I'm in Minnesota, where are you?  Are you not in Minnesota?""
""No, I'm in New Mexico.  I've never talked to someone from Minnesota before.  It's really cold there right? I heard girls wear miniskirts even in winter...""

Then we had this 25 minute long conversation where she told me about her life:

1)Her name was Cynthia iirc.

2) She has two kids, but they're such a handful she feels like she has 6.

3)She broke up with the father of her youngest child 3 years prior, but he's still a big part of their lives. (We then started talking about dead beat dads and stuff, like the other boyfriend was) She wasn't really ready for kids but hey, you know, life and stuff.

4)She wants to go back to school and become a cop, but she says none of her friends can believe that because every day she wears high heels and makeup.

5)She lives in New Mexico, 45 minutes away from texas.

6)She worked as a Spanish interpreter for a sexologist clinic. She said it was really awkward. Also, as an interpreter, you have to know absolutely word there is to know that a doctor knows, so that was pretty difficult.

7)The way that she as a telemarketer gets paid is hourly for minimum wage (5.65 there I think?) and then there is a bonus put on like commission style.

8 )She wanted to teach me some spanish, but the only word I could think of that I wanted to know was sexologist. I think in Spanish it was something super simple like sexoligio.

9)Both of us thought the other person was over 20, but it turns out she was 20 also. She said I was much more mature for someone my age than she was used to.

At one point she was talking to me and then stopped mid-sentence and started selling me a newspaper again, then apologized and said: ""Sorry, my boss was walking by.""

At the end of the conversation she said thank you because she was so happy to talk to someone and that most people either hang up or yell at her.  I had never met this person, I'm never going to meet her, and I'm never going to talk to her again, but I felt like I had had some sort of really deep experience. :-/

Catch is they overbook so you have to show up early if you want to get in, let alone decent seats.  I would say 2-3 hours before to get good seats. Especially if it's a high profile one like Tron.  So let's all make this an excuse to meet each other.  Also, in case I don't get any tickets hopefully someone will hook a brother up.  

Check out the rest of the showings for yourselves.

61644,"... those supernatural creatures (supposedly cursed Spaniards) came out of nowhere? Okay, so, in hindsight, there was a lot of foreshadowing leading up to it but it somewhat marred the experience for me. I actually only got a PS3 recently and this game was up there on my ""must play"" list. It fulfilled all of my expectations and more... up until that point. Part of what I liked about the game was that there was some sense of plausibility to it until those supernatural beings showed up. It's very much the same reason Far Cry got kicked down a few notches for me: genetic mutants mid-game.

... But that's not to say the game is instantly bad. I still consider it a very memorable experience and, on the brighter side, I did like the change of pace to a tense, atmospheric survival shooter (although the gameplay got significantly watered down; the AI of the creatures was essentially to charge headfirst into you which encouraged hip firing and exploiting the auto-aim). Overall, still a great game, just not a perfect 10/10 from me now. Anyone else feel the same way?

It seems irresponsible and silly to think that this might have an effect on me consider all the times I’ve tried to quit on my own and failed, but here we go.

I’ve been smoking pot for close to five years now, daily for the past three years and /I’m tired of it. I’ve tried to quit but will always wind up buying a little more, telling myself “what’s a couple more days” and I’ll buy a Q or less and smoke that in a few days, not really getting high anymore, just returning to a steady state. I’ve been buying pot in this way for almost four months now, I had hoped that my usage would taper off, since I was buying smaller amount, but if may have actually increased. 

I’ve been suffering due to my addiction as well, I used to be a lot of things that I no longer am. I can no longer claim to be athletic, smart or kind. I can’t run  because of my lungs and I have no special people in my life to show kindness too I’m afraid of the person I’ve become and the person I may be off the drugs. What if I’ve done permanent damage to myself? Why am I waiting for rockbottom to make a change? 

I’ve got a good job that I’m wasting away in, skipping time to smoke pot at home, great friends who I never see because I spend my weekends locked in my apartment smoking pot, I speak to my drug dealer more then my best friends. 

In the next few weeks there is a pretty good chance I’ll lose my job and I can’t tell if I’ve lost my friends as well. 

Have any of you gone through something this like, can you offer advice or some kind words for a fella in need. 




I want to quit
I want to improve
I want to be happy
I want to be loved
I want to give love
I want to know my potential

A few months ago my gmail and facebook were hacked by someone in China. I immediately changed my passwords for everything and ran virus scans, found nothing. (I have a mac at home, use a pc at work, and have an Iphone.) Since that happened I've been checking my activity log, and roughly every day since then I see someone  logging in from NY along with all my logins from DC. So, I changed my password again to something completely random with no connection to any previous passwords. I also want to mention that I've checked my sent mail and nothing at all strange has been sent to anyone. 

Now, the ip address seems to be the same every time I check: 166.137.139.31 and when I ""backtraced"" it ;) it comes up as belonging to cingular wireless which is in turn owned by att. I just got off the phone with ATT and they said there is nothing they can do for me bc of privacy acts, and suggested I contact apple for some crazy reason.

I'm kind of out of ideas now. Who should I contact? Is this something I can bring to law enforcement? I have a number from google I'm gonna try next but who knows if they will even answer it. HALP?

63667,"This is kind of tl;dr.

My mother has COPD because she's smoked since she was 12 years old. As a result, she's been in and out of the hospital more times than I can count throughout the course of my lifetime. This year has been particularly bad, and over the last six months or so she's been in the hospital five times.

Her doctors (and I) keep telling her that if she would just quit smoking, her symptoms would improve somewhat and she wouldn't get sick nearly as often. You can't reverse COPD but you can certainly try to alleviate the symptoms, and other than taking her medicine (sometimes), she refuses to help herself.

I was planning on going to visit her this morning and hang out with her for a few hours, bring her some cookies, you know, do the daughter thing. Instead, I get a call around 9 AM from her asking me to bring her two packs of cigarettes. (This has happened before.) I'm tired of enabling her problems. I told her that I care about her, and that since she's in the hospital because of her smoking, I really don't think it's a good idea for me to bring her those. She proceeds to call me a worthless person, a horrible daughter, she claimed I don't love her. She said she'll just walk to go get them herself - yes, WALK to go get cigarettes, while she's in the HOSPITAL. She hung up on me and won't answer my calls. I'm stressed.

This isn't the first time this has happened, this is just the time that it's getting to me the most. She really does not give a shit anymore, it would seem. I feel like she's trying to push me away again (this is common as well), but I can't just let that happen. She literally has NOBODY but me. She has no friends, just co-workers who hate her, and she has no family (her family is all dead, her and my father are divorced, and there are no other chldren).

Is there anything I can do to maybe make her see that no, I don't hate her, I'm not trying to be a horrible daughter.. I CARE about her, and I'd rather not see her die soon.

* matches are at times when we can watch them. starcraft is at a really really inconvenient time for many of us

* for many sports  we don't have to worry about different time zones. I am in the UK and have to be at work during the GSL. There is simply no way I can watch it.

* If it were say the football worldcup then my boss would be watching it too and we would all take off work. Starcraft unfortunately isn't quite there yet

my older shiba, who is like 11-12 years old, has always hated other dogs. always growls and bares teeth at any dog who comes near him. it's just the way he is. sometimes he will start fights with a bigger dog, and promptly loose. he just starts snapping at anything and everything, rolling over on his back to expose his vulnerable bits, and then yelping and crying like a little girl while continuing to snap. and i have to move in a separate the combatants.

i recently got another dog from a shelter. she's about twice his size. a german shepherd / retriever mix. 3 years old.

but knowing the shiba's tendencies, i first had them to a meet'n'greet at the shelter. it went fine. he would growl, she would back off and leave him alone. the staff and i agreed it would prolly be a good match.

now that she has become comfortable in the house and mastered going up and down the stairs and and all that, she won't leave him alone. when he growls and says back off. she seems to take it as an invitation to play [i think] and then a fight ensues. i have to grab her collar and pull her off of him. she's given him a few cuts near both his eyes and after he's shaking and traumatized.

i guess she is trying to establish dominance.

i don't know how to resolve this.

64033,"For a backstory: I was about 7 at the time, and both of my parents worked during that particular summer so they hired a 17-year old kid who lived down the street from us. Initially, he was pretty cool. We played a lot of video games together, he was funny, etc. 

Things started to get weird when he suggested we play a game called ""House."" This game basically involved him being the mom and my brother (who at the time was 4) and taking turns being the dad and being the son. All sorts of weird sexual exploits came from that. I don't remember a lot of it, and while I don't think there was any penetration I'm not 100% sure. I do remember him showing us pictures of mostly naked girls, telling us they were his girlfriends, then asking us if we wanted a demonstration on what he does to them. 

This lasted an entire summer. He continued to live down the street from us for about 10 years, moving out of his parents place shortly before I did. Last I heard, he's living with a girl who he got engaged to. 

And yes, this has basically eternally fucked my emotional state for all my life. I've recently gone into therapy, which helps, but I'm still confused and baffled by everything that happened to me. I tossed around the idea of doing this on my real account but the fact is I have too many friends on Reddit who I don't want to find out about this through, you know, the internet.

64182,"My friend is an adult, 22 years old male. 

We've been friends for a couple of months now and he's been through a lot for me and I have for him. There's just one problem, and that is that he keeps going back to a girl that he barely knows who is not stable.

I've had a friend who actually completely stopped talking to me because I was with a guy, so I know how shitty it is to just leave him because I don't agree with his choice to date this girl.

Now this girl:

* Is bipolar.
* Stopped seeing a psychiatrist on purpose.
* Still lives with her mother.
* Is on probation.
* 3 of her OTHER exes are still ""chasing"" her and trying to win her back.
* She often breaks up with my friend by just being like ""Wow, BYE."" and not talking to him for weeks and changing her relationship status.
* During these breaks she'd often go see her other exes.
* She has a son.
* Often ""runs away"" from home, sometimes without her son, usually to exes.

At first I didn't know her situation that well but I knew living in regret is worse than getting a little hurt, so I encouraged him to just try it out, but make sure to end things if there was any red flags. Well he dated her for a few weeks, then randomly told him she doesn't ever want to talk to him again, ran away to her exes house. This has happened 2 or 3 times. Once they break up he always claims he realized his mistake, he knows he's psycho and treats him like shit, and agrees to just move on. Then 2 weeks later he tells me that ""he was being stupid and naive."" and when I asked why he tells me he's probably getting back together with this girl. He thinks he will be this girls knight in shining armor and save her. His own words, he thinks he will ""be able to give her a good life"" and ""change her"" and ""treat her way better than anyone has treated her."" All of her previous exes STILL to this day think the exact same thing. 

I really don't know what to do. I'd feel like a bitch friend to tell him not to talk to me about her or what's going on because as a friend I should be there for him. But how am I suppose to support him with a girl who's immature, not mentally stable and has a lot of baggage, and still messing around with her exes?

It wouldn't be a free for all as people wouldn't choose how much to pay, but rather where their money (or perhaps some percent of it) would go. 

For example, when I did my taxes at the end of the year, n% would be taken as usual and the government could distribute it however it liked (the stuff most people neglect to choose). Any amount above that I could chose to put it into any number of predefined categories such as military spending, paying down the deficit, or public education.
Other than being logistically difficult and very hard to regulate, I think this could possibly work. It would all probably average out in the long run as conservatives put all of their share into clusterbombs and liberals spent all of theirs on international humanitarian aid.

65249,"Here a late FR i forgot to hand in. events happened last friday, one week ago.

The night has multiple venues and involves two of my friends, J and A.

The night started with some drinking and walking, J and  I headed from downtown to one of the party districts of the city. We saw a jazz club, deserted, but good live music. So we stayed a while an listened. I call A. and he agrees to meet us at BB later. 

BB is kind of a sit down place, good people, with a decent sized smoking area. That is rare nowadays. A. arrives and after some catching up  we head out, to get to the other party district. When we got there, J. wanted to meet some people, so A and i waited for him in a dive bar and A asked me about picking up (he didn't mention Pick-up, but i guess my former roommate told him about my new hobby). It was weird to explain the first steps of M 3 to someone, but he was interested. Too bad that was his last night in town, i would have loved for him to be my wing.

Change venue. J has to leave, so A and I head to this electronic party, decent chick to dude ratio.
I was very high energy, and managed to create a good vibe by dancing with several people. I do not recall the details, but i managed to take a fedora of someones head and he was happy about it and we goofed around a bit. I gave the hat back, started dancing again and stepped on the feet of some HB8, a cute and tiny blond who complained about, well, me stepping on her feet.
I told her i was sorry, but she has some rather large feet, so it can be hardly my fault. We joke about switching shoes for the night, she claims to not like my shoes, i tell her she is wrong, they are awesome (she likes sneakers, i never wear sneakers. Ever.). we chitchat, some kino, some IOI when i see HB10, touching some small bald dude's head. The guy was loving it. So AFC beta it hurt. Like a dog being pet.

She was a real HB10, prettiest girl in the place and she was magazine hot. Not runway funny looking hot, magazine hot. So i ditch HB8 to tell HB10 that i think it is rather rude and disrespectful to touch a smaller man's head like he is a pet. She makes excuses for her behavior but i stand my ground and then eject; i just wanted to get the disqualifier in for a possible future pick up.

That is when things went a bit wrong. I got a bit tired, did a line of speed, and was beyond the party. HB10 sucked face with some incredibly hot dude 10 minutes later and i didn't care about HB8 anymore, though she was hovering around. But i had to dance. Thanks, drugs!

I am okay with the course of the night. It was worth to burn HB8 to do my first HB10 approach, even though i only got my disqualefier in. The speed was a dumb idea, but otherwise i would've had to go home, so the night was done, anyway.

*edit:* spelling

*addendum:* on my use of drugs: they have nothing to do with what happened before.
i do not suggest gaming on drugs, i did a [lengthy FR](http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/e2jrm/fr_enhanced_experience_at_a_regular_party/) on that subject to make it clear that i disapprove of that and to describe the effect of drugs on game.
never the less, i sometimes like to take some, even though i know how that affects the game. also: speed is not meth.

65930,"I have hunted since I was 12 years old. I have also mentored many new hunters, mostly less fortunate boys who never knew, or had lost their fathers, or those whose fathers could not be bothered. Not all of the people I have taught to hunt have been children though, once in awhile one of my adult freinds will decide tot ake up the hobby, and end up joining me in the field. I have been present for many a hunters first deer, and plan to be present for many more. 

One such friend was Dom, me and Dom have spent the last few seasons in the woods together, sadly however for 3 years Dom never managed to bag himslef a deer. Last year (his fourth year in the field) we decided to go out on the last weekend of the muzzleloader season (mid December here in NY) and see if the deer were moving more now that there were less hunters to harrass them. Upon arival at the far we hunted I told Dom that I thought our best bets were either the apple crates (a stack of old apple crates at the corner of an apple orchard bordered by open hardwoods and a thick hedgerow that was only a 20 minute walk form where we park) or what we called the backpond (a 2 mile walk form where we park). I told him he could have first pick, and that I woulkd take whichever stand he chose not to. He chose the backpond. 

We geared up and came to realize that we had forgotten our two way radios, decided they were not all that important, picked a time to meet back at the van and parted ways.


I was on my stand 20 minutes later, enjoying the crips winter air, and watching the occasional squirrel or bird do what squirrels and birds do. I was on stand for maybe two hours before I heard the report of a firearm in roughly the direction Dom had headed. 

Me and Dom both shoot competitively, and are both well known for not missing. I knew that if that was indeed Dom's rifle I had heard that a deer was surely dead at his feet. I also knew that he would have no idea what to do next (beyond immediately reloading as he waited for the smoke to clear). I got up form my stand and went back to the van, I removed a few layers (dragging a deer is sweaty work) grabbed the sled I kept in the back of the van, and the tools needed to gut a deerr in the field and began the trek back to the backpond. 

I was about two thirds of the way to backpond when I heard a sort of ""fwump"" which actually sounded alot more like Dom's rifle firing a wet load than the initial report had. Now I was a little worried, I didnt want to affect Dom's hunt, if he was still hunting. I devided I would continue in his direction, and ditch the sled a few hundred yards before I reached his area so that I could make a quiter approach.

I did exactly that, and as I reached the point of the hedgerow I was using for cover I spotted my friend, bowed over, rifle slung across his chest looking left and right. It seemed to me he was hunting, but as I was about to turn around and leave him to it he bent down to pick something up and I saw that he was draggin a deer. It turned out that the second shot was in fact his, and was in fact a bit wet. However the delay in firing didnt cost him his deer, it simply turned his heart and lung shot into an instantly fatal headshot (what I call a lucky miss). When he looked up and saw me he was pretty damn happy, his plan was to drag the entire carcass to my stand and ask ""now what?"" I guided him through the process of emptying the animals guts, and we loaded it onto the sled to drag out. He was as happy as I had ever seen him, and I was glad for having shared the experience with him. 

recipe:

Easy Venison Steaks

this one is too easy for words

in a large container combine 1 bottle of dark beer (something more sweet than bitter, I use Saranac Black Forest) and one bottle of yCraft Zesty Italian dressing. Mix well. Allow thawed steaks to marinade in beer/dressing mix overnight. 

Grill on high heat about 3 minutes per side (asssuming about 1/2 inch steaks) and let sit for 3-5 minutes. Venison should not be overcooked, and if a little pink in the center turns you off wild game is probably not for you.

enjoy.

* Julian Assange released the secret cables.

**There is highly likely a deliberate media engineering effort going on to make it look like what Wikileaks is doing is illegal and Julian is being arrested for the leaks**, not for unrelated sex crime charges. This is also why MasterCard, Visa, PayPal, and others are suddenly and publicly dropping Wikileaks because of ""criminal activity"". They're feeding into the same media engineering effort.

I gotta say, the rape charges were brilliant. Even Assange's avid supporters are not gonna go out there and shout ""he's being charged with rape, but Wikileaks is 100% legal"". By not emphasizing Assange's real charges, we're playing right into the hands of the media engineers.

This is the real story, people. True modern memetic engineering in action. This is what we need to work against if we're to support Wikileaks.

Spread the word -- Julian Assange has NOT been arrested for his work on Wikileaks. What he and Wikileaks are doing is completely legal.

**Casual:**
&gt;Tank:

&gt;* Always initiate the battles.
&gt;* Know your way around the instance.
&gt;* Be aware of your surroundings. (ex: patrols, spawning mobs, etc)
&gt;
&gt;DPS:

&gt;* Never initiate
&gt;* Attack what the tank attacks
&gt;
&gt;Healers:

&gt;* Heal the tank before DPS (if the tank dies, you’ll most likely wipe)

**Hardcore:**
&gt;Tank:

&gt;* Constantly rotate targets landing at least 1 hit on each target
&gt;* AoE as much as possible
&gt;* Make sure to constantly check health bars, if someone is low make sure to taunt the mob
&gt;* Face mob away from the raid
&gt;* If you notice a mob is CC’d near you, move mob pack away to eliminate chance that CC’d mob will be AoE’d
&gt;* Don’t stand in shit on the ground
&gt;
&gt;DPS:

&gt;* Know your enemy mobs, if you know that a certain mob is specifically dangerous then kill it (which would overwrite the previous 'attack what the tank attacks' tip)
&gt;* Use Crowd Control (CC) on mobs that are farthest away, or fall into the dangerous category
&gt;* Don’t attack CC’d mobs!!!!
&gt;* Don’t stand in shit on the ground
&gt;
&gt;Healers:

&gt;* Keep an eye on debuffs and remove feared effects, diseases, etc
&gt;* Always have HoT’s on DPS that are taking indirect damage (mob AoE)
&gt;* Be healing efficient. If your heal heals for 400 and your target is only missing 200 life, wait until your target is missing 400 so you’re not wasting power.
&gt;* If your heals are HoT, don’t apply the heal again until the HoT is done. Otherwise you’re wasting power.
&gt;* Communicate that you are going to heal a specific party member so that they can conserve potions and other ""o shit spells"" (paraphrased from pri1mu5)
&gt;* Don’t stand in shit on the ground

So much as it pains me, I feel like I need to make room in the racks.  The ensoniq is obviously a goner, which is sad as it sounds bloody awesome but is fundamentally valueless.  I've also got a DBX-1531 15-stereo 31-mono graphic EQ, which I've held onto under the assumption that sometimes when you really need to dig into a bloody frequency there's nothing quite so useful as a decent graphic.

But the DBX isn't exactly decent and I haven't had to use a graphic since the mid '90s.

i keep telling myself it'll come in handy someday but I suspect that's the old-school analog in me.  And let's face it - I'm pretty old-school just for looping my FX outside the box.  Much as I'd *like* to say I'll use the hell out of that graphic, I know I won't.  I'm halfway tempted to route my Auratones (confidence monitors treasured for their shittiness) through the graph just to give it something to do, but that kind of defeats the purpose of Auratones, doesn't it?

So can anybody give me a reason to hang onto the graphic?  I'm having a hard time imagining a reason to keep it around, particularly considering the Kyma will do a 10,000 band parametric in real-time.

The good news: all functionality is encapsulated in its own JPanel. There are two or three dozen of them.

The bad news: all the GUI components, the creation code and event code and anything related to GUIdom, is in a single 8000 line text file with hundreds of variables. There's basically a set of embedded tabbed panels, with subpanels.

I am new, as of today, to Netbeans. What I want to start with is just moving each panel to its own file. I gather it will need a form underneath it, and then probably some control code to tie it into the main framework.

How does one go about 'cut-and-pasting' a panel from one class to another?

[Senate](http://www.senate.gov/general/contact_information/senators_cfm.cfm)

Remember: You have one representative, specific to your constituency, and two senators for your state, so you can contact three people. The House of Representatives has already passed the previous bill that did not give tax cuts to the richest Americans. The Senate, which has 42 Republicans, is being threatened with a filibuster if that legislation makes it to the Senate. The Republicans are filibustering because they want to give tax cuts to the richest 2% of Americans, and the Democrats, who have a majority in the Senate, do not. The deal that Obama worked out gives tax cuts to all Americans, but also includes unemployment benefits, which the Republicans were against.

A good Democratic/Independent senator message to send:

&gt; Senator,
&gt;
&gt; I am urging you to follow the advice of Senator Sanders and filibuster President Obama's proposed deal with the Republicans. This plan of action does not reflect the will of the American people and would devastate our national debt. Trickle-down economics, as we found during the Reagan era, ultimately only helps the richest Americans and not the middle class. Please do not pass legislation that would renew the tax cuts for the richest Americans.
&gt;
&gt; Regards

A good Democratic/Independent representative message to send:

&gt; Congressman (or woman),
&gt;
&gt; Please consider the deal that President Obama has negotiated with the Republicans. A renewal of the tax cuts for the richest Americans does not reflect the will of the American people. Please support the Senate, and specifically Senator Sanders' plan to filibuster this legislation.
&gt;
&gt;Regards

If you have a Republican representative or senator, then send them a strongly worded message of disapproval, clearly stating that you will not vote for them next election if they continue with this legislation. I think the ""will of the American people"" line is a good one to use.

A letter to my Republican congressman (also applicable for senators):

&gt; Congressman,
&gt;
&gt; I am strongly against the current decision made by President Obama and I am disgusted at the actions of the Republican party members of the Senate. I urge you to support legislation that would not give tax cuts to the richest Americans. Giving tax cuts to the richest Americans is against the will of the American people and would negatively impact our economy. Trickle-down economics, as we found during the Reagan era, does not work. Ultimately, the theory leaves the benefits to the wealthy and leaves none for the middle class. Do not support this legislation.

My BMI is fine, but because I have a skinny neck, and a bit of a belly, the tape measure method tells me I have 23% BF (????!!). My goal is strength and loss of fat. My diet is already pretty clean, and I am starting to eat at a deficit.


My budget is keeping me away from a gym membership, but I already own adjustable DBs up to 105 lbs. I've been doing a modified SL 5x5 with the DBs, but I've already maxed out my lifts. After researching several body weight routines, I've settled on an attempt at [Convict Conditioning.](http://www.dragondoor.com/b41.html)  I'll be doing a monthly log to show progress. I'm using December as a warm up month, to transition from my SL routine into CC, then seeing how far I can go in 2011.  


I'll be doing the ""Veterano"" CC routine, which is one of the ""Big Six"" per day for six days (squat, pushup, pullup, leg raise, bridge, handstand pushup). I'll be rounding out my routine with maintenance lifts from my SL DB routine, peppering the week with some burpee tabatas and some tennis (when it's not raining here in SF). Although the book recommends starting at Level 1 on all exercises (to build tendon strength), I am going to skip ahead in areas already covered by my SL routine, since I should have the requisite support strength already. In any new areas (bridges, handstand pushups, leg raises), I will be strict about starting at Level 1, and in all areas I am going to be strict on form and timing.


Today was my first crack at Squats, and I jumped to Level 3, which I completed. So today's entry:

* SQUAT:  Level 3; 3x30 = COMPLETE

67484,"Prompted by my filing for modification of custody, my daughter's father (my ex) has started attending his local Mormon church to appear more stable. This didn't bother me at first, it was a very transparent attempt to look better for court. What bothers me is that he has started taking my 4 year-old daughter to church with him and is actively using religion to alienate her from me.

On top of selling my child on the whole God/Mormon Church/Religion enchilada he tells my daughter that because I don't ""know God and/or Jesus"" that when she dies she won't see me in heaven. Mormon missionaries visit my ex's house during his visitation and tell my daughter that it is her job to spread the word of God to me and my husband.

My husband and I are not very religious. I was raised in the Catholic Church and drifted away from it along with my family as I became an adult (we call ourselves Recovering Catholics). My husband was raised without much exposure to religion and hasn't acquired any in his adulthood. My daughter's introduction to Mormonism through her father is the first real encounter she has ever had with religion.

This whole indoctrination/visitation thing leaves my daughter in tears when she comes home. She tells me in earnest about God and Jesus and how they will save our souls. She tells me that only bad people don't ""know God"" and I need to believe in him so I can go to heaven and live in the sky, etc, etc, etc.

I am not volatile or confrontational when it comes to religion and my lack of belief in it. I am even fine with my daughter believing in God. What bothers me is the obvious distress it causes her to be told by her father, new church friends, and missionaries that I am a bad person for not believing. It bothers me that she is less open with me and more solemn and withdrawn. I don't know what to do.

I tried telling my lawyer about this whole situation but he said that my ex can do what ever he wants with my daughter on his time, baring the physically harmful.

I really need help. I don't know how to comfort my daughter and stop her from feeling like she has to save my soul. Has anyone been in a similar situation with their child, and if so how did you counter it?

**Edit1:** I must have written this a little funky because a few people seem to be confused about my references to my *ex* and my *husband*. I left my *ex* years ago and I am now trying to modify custody. (Moving for Full Legal instead of Joint Legal) I filed a few months ago and in the same week of being served my *ex* started going to church. I have been married to my *husband* for two years now (he is very supportive and an excellent father).

**Edit2:** Wow tons of comments! Thank you everyone for your input, especially those of the LDS community (active and ex alike). I feel like I have a better handle on this now. 

I decided to go the ""expose her to other religions"" route. We had a nice little Hanukkah candle lighting tonight (though he has never practiced my husband has some Jewish heritage so we decided that was a good place to start.) We made latkas to go with dinner and she passed out very happy afterward. She seemed more like herself (happy and bright, not withdrawn as she has been) and much less stressed. I hope this continues to help.

**A little background :**

We've had infinite problems in the past on *his* end with him calling me names and being disrespectful to me in front of my/his/our friends. 

Our most infamous moment with this (it would take **FAR** too long to recount all of said moments) was when we went out for drinks with one of *my* friends and one of *his* friends on a particularly fine evening. We **all four** started joking at one point about threesomes, girl-on-girl action, etc., and my friend said something to the effect of ""Well, we all know your dress will be on my floor later,"" playing off the fact that I had borrowed one of her dresses and would (obviously) have to return it. **My boyfriend chimes in** with ""not unless I'm there with a camera"" and the joking carries on. I offer up my own joke about only giving a show if it's a makeout session because the more ""intimate"" moments are special and should be ""just for us girls"", and my boyfriend gets moody and eventually makes an excuse to leave. 

I get up to walk him out to his car and he starts yelling at me **in the middle of the parking lot** and in front of about a dozen complete strangers, calling me a ""cunt"" and a ""whore"" and a ""slut"" for saying the things I had said... and please, bear in mind that I was **only joking**, in much the same way that he was. He then proceeds to jump in his car, leave, call his friend's phone (mine isn't working) demanding to talk to me, call me some more names and then show up **AT THE BAR** with some of the things I'd left at his apartment in a box... still irate and still calling names.

We broke up over shit like this several times, and he's now gotten much better, *much to his credit*. I don't want to be unfair about this, so I need to point out that he has improved, though not completely. 

Now. We've also had problems in the past with me not telling him exactly where I am and what I'm doing, which he calls *""lying by omission""*. If I should so happen to do something and not inform him **immediately**, or make plans and not tell him about them **before they happen/before he asks**, then in his frame of mind I'm ""lying by omission"".

In some cases, he has been *justifiably angry...* I have gone out and spent the night at friends' apartments without telling him beforehand, for example, and I can see where that would be extremely upsetting. **In most cases, however, I see it differently.** I *never* lie to him about where I've been or what I've been doing when he *asks*, and if I do something as unimportant and blase as grabbing a spur-of-the-moment coffee at the campus Starbucks and I just so happen to see someone there and talk to them for half an hour, I don't feel that he needs a play-by-play of those events. =/

**Today's situation**

One of these kinds of situations arose today. I was studying and needed to share some notes with an acquaintance of mine who is in one of my classes. We met up at a copier on campus and then I decided that since I was hungry and the university cafe was right across the street, I would go have some lunch. I called my boyfriend (in response to a missed call) and asked what he was doing, to which he whispered a barely discernible ""I'm in the library studying"". I told him I was on the way to the cafe and asked if he wanted anything to eat. He said yes, so I told him I'd bring him some food. I then asked my study buddy if he wanted to tag along to the cafe and he responded to the affirmative, so we spent 30 minutes eating and then I grabbed lunch for my boyfriend and took it to him (the library is on the way back to my dorm). 

When I arrived at the library to deliver my boyfriend's food to him (in his group study room, where he was with one of our mutual friends), he asked me ""what took so long"" and I told him I ate at the cafe. He then asked who I was with and I told him. He then proceeded to tell me to not say another word about wanting to spend time with him until finals are over because I *""had an opportunity to spend a little spare time with him and passed it up to eat with some other guy""*, citing the fact that *""I didn't even ask him if he would be interested in eating with me""*. I told him that he was missing a lot in that statement, namely that 

* **(1)** he sounded like he was too busy to even talk to me, so it was natural for me to assume that he wouldn't have time to eat ***with*** me;

* **(2)** he could have asked me if I would eat with him if that's what he had really wanted, because the asking works both ways;

* **(3)** he completely missed the point that I would have eaten **at the cafe** even if my study buddy had declined my invitation to tag along.

He then proceeded to tell me to just get out, so I told *him* that if he was going to be **this ungrateful** for me bringing him food, then I would just not bother at all in the future. He then proceeded to say **""yeah, whatever, fuck off""** as I was walking out the door... once again, **IN FRONT OF OUR FRIEND**. 

I gave it 15 minutes and then sent him **this text** :

*""How about I up the ante on this one, k? You call me when you're ready to apologize, but otherwise I don't want to talk to you. That's one too many times you've blatantly disrespected me in front of people, so if you want me to 'fuck off', your wish is my command. Good luck on finals and I'll talk to you when you decide that I'm worth more than that.""*

His response was **this text** :

*""I want you to understand what happened. You went to eat lunch with someone and intentionally withheld telling me. Even when I asked what took you so long you just told me you decided to eat there. You made me have to ask you who you were with because I knew you weren't alone. And weren't you already all out of strikes and crying about how you could change? I believe so. This is the best you can do? We have a problem.""*

He then **called me** and proceeded to tell me that he wasn't *""going to have a text war with me""* and began to argue that I had *""lied to him yet again""* because I *""intentionally left details out""* and furthermore *""made him ask more than one question to get the whole story.""* 

Later, he sent **this text** :

*""You more often than not intentionally leave out the part where you were with someone else. I always have to ask or get it our of you some way other than having you just willingly tell me when I ask ""What are you doing?"" I've been over this with you time and time again on this very subject so don't even try to play ignorant. I'm sick and fucking tired of never getting the truth from you. It was just a week ago that we were having this out for the thousandth time and you wanted so badly to have another chance because you said you would do better. So, is this the 'better'? Because if it is, we will need to have a talk. If this isn't the 'better' and you just fucked up again because you weren't trying then own up to that. Either way, there is a very serious problem here.""*

**Seriously... let me outline the facts again.**

* **(1)** I always tell him who I was with when he asks. Otherwise I don't consider it important. Never do I lie to him about who I've been with or what I've been doing when the question is posed. Also, 95% of the time, I do NOT do anything that *by action alone* would cause him to be upset, so it's not like I'm withholding information and hiding illicit, non-relationship-friendly activities. (I say 95% because I'm certainly not perfect, but even that 5% isn't heinous.)

* **(2)** He flips out like this over almost everything... whether it be something as simple as a spur-of-the-moment lunch or not.

* **(3)** What he keeps referring to in his texts is another similar situation in which I decided to go Black Friday shopping with one of my best friends and texted him to tell him about it en route to Target at 5 am. His beef then was that I made plans and didn't text him to tell him about it until I was already carrying them out... thereby again ""intentionally withholding information"", ""lying by omission"" and ""informing him only as an afterthought"". In **that** case, I apologized and cried and begged for forgiveness to get him to leave me alone about it... mainly because he threw a tantrum at 1:30 AM one fine day, harassed me about it incessantly and threatened to break up with me over and over again. (yay)

There are another $770 Billion dollars worth of other stuff that is actually good in this bill including $56 billion to extend unemployment for 13 months, $300 billion for the middle class tax cuts,  $120 Billion in payroll tax cut, $40 billion for earned income credits (education), and another $30-180 billion for a tax breaks to help businesses invest. So $770 billion out of $900 billion is for pretty good stuff. Not nearly as bad as I though it was.

And for those of you who don't know what the hell I'm talking about, I'd love to explain it to you but I'm merely an amateur and don't know enough about it to fully explain it yet.

**I've tried going to the bar with friends of course and its the same thing every time:**

Girls go about their thing with friends showing no indicators of interest.  If/when I do walk up to one they end up being bitchy and this turns me off instantly.  (exit convo asap.)


**I've tried online dating sites (plentyoffish + okcupid):**

Most of the girls I don't find attractive, those that do don't respond.  I have no doubt that the guy/girl ratio on these sites is incredibly skewed towards guys. (blasting mass messages to the girls to see who responds)  My pictures are fully clothed and normal, my profile tells describes me truthfully.  Regardless I get the sense that the attractive ones get spammed by dudes and most are on there for an ego boost at best.


Unfortunately none of my guy friends currently have girl friends or friends that are girls to speak of.  I always feel like a tool doing the obvious random approach on the street or something and am really at wits end as to how to fix my problem.  Any redditors have any ideas?

But the question: is there anyone here that, like me, uses only the bike as means of transportation and, so, rides dozens of kilometers every single day? If so, next question:

Any of you use a lot the hands while biking? I use a lot and lot because one of my legs suffered necrose and is almost useless. If someone answered this with yes, the last question follows:

Any of you are having problems of numbness in one or more fingers, possibly the 4th and 5th of the left hands? If so, for how long? Hod did you solve it? 

I got a job recently more far away from home (some 12 kilometers), some months ago, and now my fingers are becoming numb. I am 29 years old and this is something new to me.

73057,"Normal for me is depression. I don't remember the last time I wasn't truly depressed (not including my brief reprieve recently). Must have been when I was a kid and didn't know any better.

I've posted here before. More than once. I've posted in the AMA's about how I was going to go across the US to meet the girl I'd been talking to for over two years. No one directly asked me but it didn't work out. While on the ride back home she told me she didn't want to be in any relationship at the moment. Later she asked if we could still be best friends. I thought I could deal with the whole situation at the time but the reality is coming back slowly. No love lasts forever, and I'll probably be alone for the rest of my life.

I'd never thought about suicide before I met her. I also never drank. Not that I drink a lot. But one night I just got pushed over the edge and got myself drunk. And now I think about suicide a lot. Not that I'd do it.... For some reason I have some kind of mental block against it. I'd never do it. And that's another depressing point- there's no way out for me. I can't kill myself, I don't have enough money for food, let alone alcohol or drugs. I have no friends. I have no time to do anything but work. I'm stuck in this existence.

No, I know what reddepression will say, and I don't want to talk to anyone. My parents and I are as distant emotionally as strangers, and I never want to open up to them about any of this. There's no one else to talk to. I desire to talk to therapists even less than my parents, and I couldn't afford them anyway.

Sometimes I feel I see a light, a little bit of happiness here or there. It's maddening because I don't have the means to reach it. Happiness might be completing a new website, but I never reach it because I don't have the attention span or work ethic to finish. I don't have the creativity and my intelligence is waning. I realize all this and the light goes away and life sucks again.

I don't know.... Depression is normal for me. It used to be comforting because it was the thing I remembered. But my trip showed me how to be happy for a few days. I guess I never really knew what I was missing and I was okay with it. Now I know. I did things on that trip that I want to do again but know I never will. I know what I'm missing now and that just makes my life worse.

Anywho, we play on a regular basis with some of our friends, the only problem is that they all play really overpowered foolish decks that at the moment has me and the bf saying ""We can't play until we get something better."" In fact, we're pretty tired of losing. It's come to the point that I will hold off on attacking or using any of my cards like Pillory of the Sleepless or Oblivion Ring, because I will automatically become the biggest target on the board, regardless of how many others on the board are bigger threats. So, I guess I just need some help sprucing up my regular playing deck because I don't have enough knowledge of the cards (and access to a rather small amount of cards) myself. I've tried to look for other cards that will help, but it seems that I just can't turn it into a working deck with amazing abilities.

73105,"Hi all

So I was smoking up for the 3nd time ever (1st times were nice), and I shared 1 joint with a mate. So the first 10 minutes were good, but this was the first time I went into a public place stoned. My mate left me for a couple minutes and I started getting mad paranoid that someone would find out about me.

What followed was the worst thing I've ever felt in my life and what I think would be the worst thing that could happen to anybody.

The feeling was that everything was running in a loop and nothing was real - like I was living a nightmare. When I told my friend to take me to ER, we were backing up out of the driveway and that sequence of backing up played over and over and over...like we weren't making any progress. It was horrific. Every now and then I calmed down but was jolted into a terrible feeling of 'this isn't real, this will never end'.

After a bit of driving (which took forever in my mind), I was convinced the loop was permanent and that I needed to die. I was looking for ways to kill myself because I was in hell.

When we got to the clinic it was night and even though we went up just 2 flights of stairs it felt like I went up 10. Then the worst part of the night - we entered a DARK waiting room that was a long narrow corridor. This is where shit got real. I used to have thoughts a few years back that the worst fate ever would be to be permanently stuck in a corridor that you can't escape. Yep, it felt like forever, and the aforementioned 'jolts' made things so much worse. It was so eerie, my friend was trying to calm me down, but in my mind it was so warped, like he was saying 'calm down. it's ok. we're stuck here and there's nothing you can do. just accept it. just accept it'. There was a person walking up and down the corridor constantly, not even turning their head. I thought I was doomed to stay stuck forever, hallucinating, in a corridor.

Eventually I got a tranquilizer shot and slept it off. This was so ridiculously terrifying....is it normal? Anyone else got similar stories?

""But surely it takes a long time, and time is money"", I hear you thinking. It takes almost no time for me to make a new account and then again. If I had to run an ad that would cost at least $ 20 per day. And I would get the most out of 50 clicks a day of it. Yes, I did publish ad once to find out this!

So you know, is much more profitable to spam than it is to buy ads with them. Do not expect to go away.

74685,"So, a little background on the story. I parked my car in the alley behind my apartment last night. I usually park on the street but there's a church across the street and they use my parking spot when church is in session. It's annoying but there's not really anything I can do since the street isn't designated parking. Anyways, I've parked here before, but not very often. 

So I wake up this morning to go to work. I get out to my car to leave and I see the door is partially open. I don't lock my doors and it's because my car is a POS and I don't leave anything valuable in it. I don't even have a radio. But I open the door and I see that someone has obviously searched every part of my car. I also see that my seat covers (old flame pattern cloth ones that came with the car when I bought it), rearview mirror (also a cheap add-on that came with the car) and my backpack are missing. As far as I can tell, this is all that was stolen. They didn't open the trunk and take the home theater amp/six disc changer I have in there (I have no use for it so it stays in my trunk). They took the 30' Monster XLR cable that was in my backpack **OUT** of my backpack and left it on the seat. They left my wife's $90 pair of shoes that were on the floor of the car. But they took the seat covers, rearview mirror, and backpack. Now... I'm confused. Does anyone have any idea why these were taken?

tl;dr Someone broke into my car, stole useless items, and left slightly expensive things behind. WTF?

74689,"Little background... I come from an upper middle class family. My parents are pretty tight with money, but then, I guess that's why they have any. A few years ago my grandma, whose memory was failing, moved here (California) from North Carolina. Since then my dad has been visiting her every day, usually two or three times, to check on her, bring her groceries, cook her meals and everything. She's always been pretty dramatic (according to my dad, she ""needs righteous indignation like other people need oxygen"") and occasionally wanders off and gets picked up by the police. But she was never officially declared to be incapable of functioning on her own because my dad did everything for her instead of the state. On Thursday, she disappeared. The police were looking for her, flyers were put up, I think there was even a brief mention of it on the news, but at the end of the day no one could find her. The next day we found out she convinced a friend in North Carolina to buy her a plane ticket and an at-the-door pickup service, something she absolutely could not do on her own. My parents say what her friend did is illegal and my dad is petitioning to have her moved to an elder care home (according to the police, she can't live on her own anymore), which of course means getting a court to declare that she's mentally incapable of maintaining herself. This is all well and good, and I'll admit I was getting sick of hearing about it all the time. Except this morning on the way to school my mom told me that right before she left she changed her will... to give me and both my brothers (one of whom, interestingly, is a half brother on my mom's side) each a house.

Needless to say, I'm pretty surprised. I'm guessing that as soon as she's declared incapable of handling herself the will goes into effect. I figure once she can't control her own finances anymore it just defaults to the will. But it's so morally conflicting. My dad deserves this more than me. But my grandma's Alzheimer's has killed her relationship with him and she wrote him out. He says he's okay with it, but I just can't justify taking something I haven't earned. At the same time, I need it a lot more than him, but still... does that matter? On top of that, I feel horrible about benefiting from what's happening to my grandma, but someone has to, right? Ugh.

If karma could be used by the 'owner' to give additional upvotes (even if you have 0 karma you can give one upvote), wouldn't reddit be better? Users could spend x amount of karma points to give another users comment x number of upvotes. I would support a 1:1 ration but I'm sure smarter individuals than I would actually be able to figure out an optimal exchange rate (maybe even charge more karma for popular posts?). 

The new reddit economy could not be used for downvotes, however, as this would lead to one person sinking an idea they meerly disagree with. 

There are a couple growing pains I can imagine happening. For instance, with a wealth of karma out in the reddit community already, spending/hoarding would be done somewhat chaoticly until users adjusted to a balance and learned to manage their 'spending' wisely. 

Also, with a finite amount of karma, karma-hoarders and 'trusts' might evolve and attempt to control message boards to their liking, possibly requiring some form of regulation (dare I say, moderation?). 

One longterm benefit that I see from this is an exponential increase in comment quality and thoughtfulness. Also, saving/spending karma sounds kind of fun to me.

So reddit, any thoughts on this? Other possible problems? Anyone else tired of karma not meaning anything?

I am a student and I have an interest in web development. I have some experience in RoR. I have made some simple sites with it. I want to learn asp.net.

After a bit of looking and doing tutorials I can see it's quite a bit different. A user authentication system comes with it - using providers. That's a bit confusing but seems smart.

I am kind of lost on how to go about laying out a project.

* **Database** - if I am using the Membership database that comes with it, do I put my own tables in there too? If so, do I follow the same naming conventions aspnet_NAME? If not, where do I put it?

Now to introduce the characters (All names fictional):
**Me**- 23 y/o female
""**Hester Prynne**""-25 y/o female, a good friend of mine and had been a good friend of Eve and Mary.
**Mary**- 23 y/o female, dated(?) Judas from winter-march '09 and then from fall '09 to now. Best friends with Eve, good friend with Hester and decently social with me.
**Judas**- 23 y/o Male. Dated Mary and Eve before her. (Fall '08-spring '09) A good friend/confidant of mine. Friend of Hester's.
**Lex**- 25 y/o Male. Lex and I dated from fall of '08 to summer of '09.
**Eve**- 23 y/o Female. Had been my best friend and roommate from '07 to fall of '09. Currently Mary's best friend. Has been dating Mike since fall '09
**Mike**- 24 y/o male. Has been dating Eve since fall '09. Mike and I dated briefly the summer of '09. Mike and Judas are best friends.

*Whew!* Got all that? Good. Now get ready for some royal clusterfuckery.

Long ago in a galaxy far, far away, Hester, Eve, Lex, Judas and I were all good Friends. Lex and I were a couple and Judas and Eve were a couple. Hester would hang out with us on the weekends and we'd do all sort of fun things together. Sadly, things were not meant to last. Eve and Judas broke up and Lex graduated college so we broke up as well. I was sad and started dating Mike as a rebound.  Eve was sad too and spent the summer traveling. During that summer she was my confidant and she and I worked through our respective breakups.  When Eve got back into town that fall she met my guy Mike. Eve and Mike hit it off real well and Mike dropped me for Eve. I was pretty annoyed by that and started spending more time hanging out with my other friends Hester and Judas. Judas and Lex meet up randomly that autumn and Judas learns that Eve and Lex were having an affair while Lex and I were dating. Judas tells me this and Eve and I have a fallout, we are no longer friends. I cut all contact with Eve, Lex and Mike. 

Eventually, Judas starts dating this girl Mary. She's a friend of Hester's and Eve's. Since she's dating my friend Judas I see her around more often. We are on decent terms. Judas end up Mary break up and Mary starts hanging out more with Eve. Since Judas has more time on his hands he, Hester and I hang out more often. One day, Judas learns that Lex and Eve's affair went back way later than we both thought-- to the time while Judas and Eve were together AND Lex and I were together. Judas and I share a bottle of whiskey, an 18 rack of beer and a pack of cigarettes. We have the worst sex in the history of drunk sex ever. Judas and I agree it will never happen again and never speak of it to anyone.

That summer Judas and Hester's relationship becomes one of friends with benefits. The three of us would go out drinking and then the two of them would go home together. Mary did not know about this and was out of town during the summer. To my Knowledge, I was the only person who knew about Judas and Hester's relationship.

A few months later summer's over and Judas and Mary decide to get back together. Judas and Hester no longer sleep together and don't see each other any more. Since Judas and Mike are best friends and Eve and Mary are best friends, the four of them become a cute little group and go on double dates all the fucking time. Often Eve, Mary and Hester will get together for 'girl time' and very occasionally Mary will join me and Hester for a drink out. Hester gets into a grad school across the country and moves away around November of '09. Without Hester as the middle person I don't really see much of Mary as she spends all her time with Judas/Eve/Mike.

Fast forward a year to this past weekend. Hester is still in her grad program. Eve and Mike are still together and live in the same city. Judas and Hester are doing a LDR, both in grad programs across the country. I got a job and am working in a different state as well. What happened next is a little unclear to me as I wasn't there but it sounds like Hester, Eve and Mary were all on skype or something and Mary and Eve were making jokes about Judas's penis. Hester joined in and laughed along with them. Suddenly Mary got it and phoned Judas to talk to him about it. Cat was out of the bag.

Day 1 post-fallout Mary is mostly harassing Hester, calling her a slut and sending her waves of angry text messages and facebook messages. Mary starts threatening Hester with physical harm should the two women ever meet again. Hester blocks Mary's phone number and from facebook. Hester then warns me of the fallout. Yesterday, I woke up to 3 wrathful text messages from Mary and 2 angry facebook messages. I do not respond to Mary's messages (got work to do!) and continue to receive more messages from Mary throughout the day. Her tone sounds increasingly psychotic as she calls me a whore, slut, desperate, pathetic, deceitful, cowardly. She continues to threaten me, apparently provoked by my silence until I block her phone number and facebook. 

Since then, I've set my twitter to private and have been attempting to erase my presence online, limiting it to my professional website. While Mary has both my personal email and Hester's email she has yet to email us.


I'm not asking for sympathy but advice on damage control. Mary and I have some mutual friends and it's very likely that she is telling them about this. Is this a situation where I should just stay quiet and probably avoid my five year college reunion? I am very glad for the state lines between Mary and I but worried as she's told me that if she ever finds out I'm in the same city as her I  should ""watch my back"".


At what point do I need a restraining order?

78393,"Most metaphorical declarations of war in the past several decades have been brokered in to excuse all sorts of behaviors that we wouldn't tolerate otherwise.  Rhetoric about a war on drugs lulled us into a situation in which possession is considered trafficking, and people are sent to prison for possession of minor drugs they keep for private use.  Rhetoric about a war on terror has facilitated to the same erosion of our personal liberties that reddit has opposed since the beginning.

The word ""war"" often acts as an inhibitor to clear thought.  Convince people that there's a war on, and they'll consent to things that under less hyperbolic conditions they'd avoid.  Often, that's the very reason people invoke the specter of war in the first place.

I've already seen redditors using the suggestion of a cyber war to excuse actions that will harm people who have no direct influence over what happens to Wikileaks.  This needs to stop before it gets out of hand.  Maybe no one is being physically injured, but as we've already seen countless times, people's reputations and finances *can* be hurt over the internet.  We spend a lot of time just playing on reddit, but we've seen how a site like this can change lives, and not always for the better.

I did every drill in the easiest way possible to exert as little effort as possible; People kept telling me to flex my abs as I did things, but no way in hell I was doing that. I held my breath some to seem like I wasn't gasping so much, and I never had any fun. Basically, my goal was to do as little as possible.

But today I realized I'm supposed to do the opposite. I should get every possible muscle involved in everything, suck down as much air as I need, and have some fucking fun. I've been trying to survive each set, to do as little as possible and still be able to tell someone I squatted 150. I need to just do the damn set, trying to wring as much out of it as I can.

How on earth do you wear dresses, or certain shirts, or anything will a low back? I'm a 36C, and my breasts *don't* stay up on their own. Are these options just closed to me? I definitely can't go braless--it's not a look I'm fond of--but otherwise the straps/claps shows a lot, which just doesn't look good, in my opinion.

[dress 3](http://static0.modcloth.com/productshots/0059/4857/24438-1.jpg) - i'm guessing something like this is just totally out of the question for me.

[dress 4](http://static1.modcloth.com/productshots/0058/6235/24124-2_quicklook.jpg) - the front of this would work with a bra, but the sides and the back? no way.

[dress 5](http://static1.modcloth.com/productshots/0058/4915/23710-2_quicklook.jpg) - this one is great in the back and the front, but the sides/underarms would definitely show a bra.

[shirt 1](http://static1.modcloth.com/productshots/0052/3942/18688-3_quicklook.jpg) - this one is fine around the shoulders and sides, but suddenly in the back there's a great big hole right where the bra will be.

Bras with racerback-style (or generally protean) straps still have backs. I do know about strapless/backless bras, but they don't really work, in my experience?

I have fashion tape breast lifts, but those aren't really adequate for what I've got--and they don't seem like they'd be too good for the skin in the long run.

I reply, ""It's the law, I'm not telling you to do anything."" At this point she attacks me again, ""Well maybe if you got out here more."" I stop her, ""I've lived here a lot longer than you."" (Why should it matter how much I exercise or where I take my dog to do it?)

She's trying to get me upset because she doesn't want to respect a simple and important law. I don't want to have my dog leashed as much as the next guy, but I'm not going to break the law because I think I can.

80722,"I am a 31 year old female.  My fiance broke up with me 6 months ago.  He is already in a new relationship.  I check his and his new girlfriend's facebook pages probably every other day.  I am weak.  I also have recently come to the realization that I check their pages because I'm waiting (hoping) for them to break up.  Somewhere in my addled mind, I've come to the conclusion that I can't be happy until they break up.  I am such a terrible person.  I don't want my fiance back, because we were terrible together.  We were both miserable.  But for some reason I think that if their relationship ends, that our relationship didn't work because there was something wrong with him, not me or us.  I can't move on because....  I don't really know why. 

It isn't reasonable or right to be hoping for them to break up.  It's not even that I want him (or his new girlfriend) to be in pain.  I guess I think if they break up that he's not capable of having a relationship, and it's not just that we weren't meant to be.  Thinking that we weren't meant to be is too hard.  

How do I move on?  How do I not care that he's with her and happy?  Why do I think that if they break up then that means that our breakup isn't all that bad.  Something isn't firing properly in my brain.  I need help getting over the end of our relationship, and help to realize that he isn't a part of my life anymore.  And what he does shouldn't affect me anymore.  

Edit:  We're not even friends on FB. I check his profile (even though all his stuff is private) because it shows his relationship status. it's so pathetic.

I deleted all his/our emails, and blocked him from my personal and work email accounts the day after we broke up. I deleted his phone number. We have no friends in common. There is nothing except my memories that won't let me forget him. I don't know what to do.

81353,"I have only smoked weed a handful of times and have always either not gotten very high and been bored, or gotten extremely stoned and had a frightening experience.  I'm going to give it another try again soon and in honor of that I've decided to share my first experience with getting high:

I came home from work one night and my roommate (I was in a dorm room at the time) and one of his friends were attempting to build a gravity bong out of a two liter bottle of soda.  They asked if I wanted to join in and I enthusiastically agreed, still dying to know what it felt like to be high.  They were unsuccessful in building the gravity bong so we decided to just smoke out of my roommate's bubbler.  Bound and determined to get thoroughly high this time I let go of all my better judgment and took a huge hit every time it was offered to me.  I kept remarking about how the bubbler hit so smooth it was like I was just breathing air.  I must have taken about 10 solid hits over the course of about 10-15 minutes.  I was already feeling the effects and it felt fucking awesome.  My whole body felt great and I had a feeling this was going to be a great night.  That's when i received a text on my cellphone.  It was a text from my roommate that I was receiving approximately half an hour after he had sent it.  This, to me, was the most hilarious thing I had ever experienced and I physically could not stop laughing.  My roommate and his friend joined in with great amusement, wondering how I could find something so mundane hilarious.  That's when my journey really began...

All of a sudden feeling very self-conscious about my laughter I ordered my roommate and his friend to stop laughing at me.  This was very difficult to do given the fact that I still could not physically control my own laughter.  Once I got my own laughter under control they started playing Super Smash Bros.  I enjoyed watching them play for maybe 30 seconds before the colors made me feel like I was going to vomit.  I asked if they could please turn off the TV for a little bit while I adjusted to the feelings of being high.  They agreed and in the meantime the room began to close in on me.  I am extremely claustrophobic so this feeling resulted in me just sitting on my bed hugging myself tightly, anticipating my inevitable demise -- being crushed to death by the walls of my own bedroom.  I began to experience chills and I felt like every hair on my entire body was standing on end.  At this point my roommate advised me that it would be a good idea for me to just try to sleep it off.  So we turned out the lights.  My roommate and his friend started surfing the internet on his computer while I tried to sleep.  After what seemed like a very long while I must have been on the verge of falling asleep.  At this point I got the sensation that I was laying in a hospital bed in a coma.  I then heard the sound of my heart flatlining on the heart monitor (I assume it must have actually been intense ringing in my ears).  As a result I became extremely convinced that I had just witnessed my own death.  I immediately got out of bed and started yelling ""I'm going to pass out!  Call for help!""  Don't ask why I said that, it just seemed like a good idea at the time.  My roommate turned on the light and I all of a sudden had the sensation that I woke up from a dream.  I hollered out ""It's okay I'm awake now!""  I didn't immediately remember any of the preceding events of the night, so when they came back to me I realized that I had not woken up.  I had been awake the whole time.  This really freaked me out because I had been so sure just moments ago that I woke up from a bad dream -- but it turned out that that bad dream was reality.

Following this unfortunate event, the three of us sat on the floor of the room and discussed what it was like to be high; we related our current experiences and they shared with me their first experiences.  All the while I was trying to deal with multiple new sensations.  I felt as though my entire body was shaking uncontrollably and there was nothing I could do to stop it.  I felt like my vision had been enhanced so that I was seeing everything magnified (I felt like I could see very clearly every single pore on my roommate's friend's face).  I also had the sensation that the entire room spinning around us and I kept moving my head from side to side to try to counteract the resulting dizziness.  I also had to be constantly touching somebody for reassurance that I was still existing in this world.  If I was not touching anybody then I began to lose the sense of touch over my entire body.  In fact, if I closed my eyes and I was not touching anybody then I felt as though I was somersaulting backwards through infinite space, all alone in my own void.  If I kept my eyes closed then the somersaulting would speed up and begin to become erratic, making me very motion sick.  As I was beginning to get these new feelings under control I all of a sudden got an extreme headrush which prompted me to stand up very quickly.  This gave me the sensation that I woke up yet again and, once more, I hollered ""I'm awake!  I'm awake!""  I then immediately realized that I had been awake the entire time and my initial, frightened response was ""Oh God, I'm the man with the 30 second memory!"" (Google it if you don't know who that is).  This theory was quickly discredited when I realized that I remembered the entire night.  I then continued to struggle with all of the ridiculous feelings I had been experiencing all night until I had eventually come down enough to enjoy it (about 4 hours after I had taken the 10 hits).  I had the sensation of waking up from a dream approximately 15 times over the course of the night, but after a while it just became amusing.  So, basically, I endured 4 hours of a terrifying experience to enjoy my high for about an hour.  The second time I got stoned led to another terrifying, but very different experience.  This time...I will not smoke so much.

Lots of games to play

Virtual fields to plow

I hear my modem's ringing notes

I'm getting ready to surf the net

My mouse is my surfboard among the boats

I hope I don't get wet

I found a forum to post my thoughts

I shared some secrets and a myspace link

Hoped these strangers would connect the dots

Request my friendship, and send me a wink

But these kids weren't looking for a friend

Just cruising the internet city streets

Like a gang of criminals ready to send

to hell the first person that they meet

My stories and pictures were met with contempt

Inside me a tree of sadness began to grow

They knocked down everything I began to attempt

With such words as ""Cool story bro""

Now the waves of the internet sea

Come crashing down on top of me

My sand castle on the beach of the web

Was crushed by the very flow and the ebb 

I cried on every website, every guestbook I could find

I shared my emotions very neatly outlined

Wrote 4 poems about suicide by fire

People don't like them, they say I'm a liar

Let me get back on my surfboard and get out of here...

Today I quit the internet

I had no place to hide

Mom won't let me on the internet

It's like a roller coaster kids shouldn't ride

82240,"Hey all, this came up in class tonight, and I thought I would post it here.  This mostly pertains to starting level protoss (bronze and maybe silver) It is a concept that I stole from EmoStarcraft (feel free to check him out on youtube.com/user/emostarcraft ) that pertains to having an appropriate number of production buildings per saturated base.  It is the 4 point system, here's how it works.

Each saturated base is worth 4 points that you have to spend on production buildings.  Each of the protoss production buildings can be considered to have different value in points.  A gateway, for instance, is worth one point.  This means that, for the most part, you can sustain production out of 4 gateways (4 total points) on one saturated base.  The other production buildings (stargate and robo bay) are each worth 1.5 points each.  The point value that you want to aim for, therefore, is 4 plus or minus .5 points.  As such, you can end up with 2 gateways and a robo bay, or 3 gateways and a robo bay ( 3.5 and 4.5 points respectively).  You will notice that most combinations lead to under and over production (predicted) via this system.  This fluctuations allow for expansions/upgrades/etc... Hitting 4 points worth of produciton buildings will probably lead to underproduction, in all honestly, but only slightly.  That is, you will be stuck only able to produce out of those structures, and you don't have room for flexibility.  Tangent: this is where a 4 gate falls short, it becomes difficult to transition out of the 4 gate because you are already operating really at your maximum capacity for your economy.  But back to the idea.  You can then deduce that as you expand, the amount of production points you can sustain moves to 8.  At this point you really might consider undershooting that mark, though, as upgrades and flexibility become really important.  4 gates and 2 robos, for instance is good here (7 points).  If I think of more details to add here, I will come back and edit.  Hope this helps!

Note: This is not a mock draft. It only includes 25 players and doesn't guess which team will choose which player. Rather, it tries to rank the top 25 players by their draft eligibility.

* = Junior or draft eligible sophomore.

 1) Andrew Luck * QB -- Analysis: Now completing 70.2 percent of passes in pro-style offense. Arm, smarts and intelligence are all there. Gift-wrapped QB pick. Last week: No. 1

 2) Da'Quan Bowers * DE -- Analysis: His 24 TFL are second nationally. A tremendous physical talent who has shown steady relentlessness this year. Ideal size for 4-3 DE. Last week: No. 2

 3) A.J. Green * WR -- Analysis: Green has been mostly unstoppable even with young QB. Not sure people realize what kind of route-runner he's become. Last week: No. 3

 4) Patrick Peterson * CB -- Analysis: More than freak athlete, Peterson has continued to improve his technical cover skills. Has quietly become among nation's top return threats. Last week: No. 4

 5) Prince Amukamara CB -- Analysis: I'd be more concerned about Amukamara's zero interceptions in 2010 if any quarterback was willing to challenge him. A gifted technician. Last week: No. 5

 6) Nick Fairley * DT -- Analysis: Brilliant season from Fairley. He's dominated even while not 100 percent at times. He simply epitomizes the ideal penetrating 4-3 DT. Last week: No. 6

 7) Ryan Mallett * QB -- Analysis: Mallett has become far more than a big arm. Patience, poise and willingness to check down have enhanced his stock. Last week: No. 9

 8) Cameron Newton QB -- Analysis: Once more, Newton got to show that he's more than a mere running threat. Capable of extending plays to use his big arm. Last week: No. 14

 9) Julio Jones * WR -- Analysis: Jones had a stellar junior season; when healthy, he was impossible to stop; when not, he was still good. Greater ability to separate in 2010. Last week: No. 10

10) Marcell Dareus * DE -- Analysis: Played well early against Auburn in his last game, but looked worn with the rest of Bama's defense late. Best suited as 4-3 DT at the NFL level. Last week: No. 8

11) Robert Quinn * DE -- Analysis: Freakish athlete with decent size, great quickness and pass-rush skills. Ineligible all year, but scouts are captivated by his talent. Last week: No. 7

12) Ryan Kerrigan DE -- Analysis: Led country with 26 TFL, he became simply impossible to block, even against double-teams. He's ideal for 3-4 OLB, possible 4-3 DE. Last week: No. 12

13) Von Miller LB -- Analysis: Miller has shown recently that his ability to drop and cover has grown. Good 3-4 pass-rusher, with great edge quickness; sack machine. Last week: No. 15

14) Justin Blackmon * WR -- Analysis: Wrapping up a breakout season, he has been impossible to keep covered. Good size and speed combo with ability to set up DBs. Last week: No. 13

15) Akeem Ayers * OLB -- Analysis: His exceptional athleticism makes him so versatile. Ideal every-down 3-4 OLB who can rush and cover. Ayers should test well in Indy. Last week. No. 12

16) Drake Nevis DT -- Analysis: Explosive, up-the-field tackle. Ideal three-technique who plays with great leverage and passion. Solid against run and pass. Last week: No. 16

17) Nate Solder OT -- Analysis: Physical freak with improved skills. Should dominate in workout phase and could get bump in draft short on elite OTs. Last week: No. 17

18) Anthony Castonzo OT -- Analysis: Smart, reliable, solid footwork but could add lower-body strength to become better leverage player. Back up after rough stretch. Last week: No. 18

19) Adrian Clayborn DE -- Analysis: Sacks were down but increased attention was part of that. A guy who batters offensive linemen; has great motor. Last week: No. 20

20) Derek Sherrod OT -- Analysis: A later entry to the Big Board this year. An athlete at OT, ha moves his feet well and has been steady against good players; continues to improve. Last week: No. 21

21) Gabe Carimi OT -- Analysis: Has had fantastic fall, battling a number of likely high draft picks to standstill. Once beaten by speed too often, his footwork has improved. Last week: No. 22

22) Mark Ingram * RB -- Analysis: Average per rush now tick below last year, but explosive and physical after being dinged early. Solid finisher but top-end speed is in question. Last week: No. 19

23) Jake Locker QB -- Analysis: Skill set is fantastic, but poor year overall. Has done a great deal of his best work versus bad competition. Last week: No. 23

24) Rahim Moore S -- Analysis: Production down this year after breakout 2009 season, but QBs also stayed away. Good instincts, and he gets solid marks as cover safety. Last week: No. 24

25) Jon Baldwin * WR -- Analysis: Great physical skills and size. Baldwin has had a rocky season -- games with 1, 3, 2, 3 catches -- but QB issues were part of that. Last week: No. 25

If I haven't introduced myself more formally, my name's Mike Bleskie, and I'm a director with the Pirate Party of Canada. On the [7th of December](https://www.pirateparty.ca/forum/index.php?topic=589.0), we had a [four-hour meeting](http://www.pirateparty.ca/uncategorized/on-wikileaks) for our members regarding the direction of the party in relation to Wikileaks, and the presence of Reddit was notable in several interested redditors coming to inquire and to participate in the meeting. I am going to [do my best](http://www.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/ehdv8/pirate_party_canada_votingmeeting_on_whether_to/) to make myself available to /r/canada during this process.

I'm specifically making this thread to talk about the meeting. I know several members of the Reddit community were there (including one fellow blatantly nick'd as ""Redditor"", and I know iJeff was there, heyo) to take part. The big complaint I got was that the meeting was slow and mechanical, with several bugs. I will just say that the moderators of the debate (Sean Hunt, our Clerk, was speaker, Shawn Gray was in charge of monitoring attendance, and yours truly was in charge of the vote tallying) were extremely concerned that the polar opposite sides of the debate were going to rip each other to shreds, and so we set up a system so that order was prioritized. People had issues with their PINs, which we sorted out as best as we can. But, we still had people not happy with the process.

Logs of the meeting will be available in the very near future. Web and phone polling should now be available for approximately **three** days. I appreciate any feedback on the process so far, and I will try and answer questions and concerns. Just note that I will be unavailable for a about a week, after next Thursday, but in the meantime you can message me here on Reddit, or email me at bleskie@pirateparty.ca.

84155,"I love BC2 as much as the next guy, but I'd have to say, I'm not a fan.
(Obligatory disclaimer: yes its great they have us to it for free etc etc)
If you take out the 'herp derp new maps I was so bored of the other ones' factor and look at the maps objectively, I'm not sure they're comparatively as good as the originals that came with the game.

I never thought I'd say this, but I actually think they're too big.  If BC2 was 64 player, we'd have no problems at all, but as of right now a few of them are so spread out you spend half the game travelling, which doth not a fun game make.

**Cold War**
So narrow and medic infested that most of the games I've played have simply been 16 medics mowing each other down in a hallway (one of three hallways actually- left flank, right flank, down the middle).  The snow glare/wind makes killing people so hit and miss there is nothing tactical whatsoever about the map.  If I wanted an arena shooter I'd go play COD.

**Oasis**  Probably the best of the new maps on conquest.  On rush it is so ridiculously unbalanced in favor of the defenders its not even funny.  A _barely_ competent defending side can hold the first or second set of bases with ease.  Boring as shit on defense and rage inducing on attack.

**Harvest Day** is okay at best.  holding points on conquest is a bit of a crap shoot.  There's pretty much no solid cover, or anywhere to hide, meaning that staying alive is luck of the draw.  This should normally be balanced out by the fact there is little cover for an attacker, but with only 16 a side, covering four bases with 360 degrees of possible attack avenues using BC2's broken ass/unused voice comms makes it a difficult job.  And not a difficult job as in a challenge, I mean a difficult job as in frustrating and not fun.  Admittedly, I haven't played a rush game of harvest end to end yet, so can't comment there.

**Heavy Metal** isn't bad, but again, with only 16 players a side, engagements are short and traveling times are long.  The massive bias against helicopters (engi's with tracers, AT4's, tank turrets, tank alt weapons, mounted MG's, Vads, AA-Guns) coupled with the post-patch 'helicopters fly like shopping trolleys' physics make staying in the air more luck than skill.

So yeah, again, I'm not moaning that we're getting content for free- its great of dice/ea to do that when they probably could have got away with making it paid-for DLC, so I really appreciate that they're doing that for us, but in comparison to the perfectly sized and (for the most part) pretty well balanced original maps (think Port Valdez and Arica Harbour for example), I don't really rate them.

(For the sake of this scenario, assume that you are provided with whatever proof you would require to be satisfied that this entity before you is, without question, Allah. Establish that this is not Satan or a demon or anybody else trying to trick you, but the one and only God.)

Allah says to you:

“I am Allah, your Lord. I have come to you to command you to fulfill the destiny for which you were brought into this world – to perform a mission as the Hand of Allah.

“You know that I am the creator of all things. You know from the teachings of the Qur’an that I am all merciful and find joy in the glory of my creation, Man, but you must also know, as an educated person, that I also created anguish and suffering.

“Suffering is as important as joy in my creation. It is necessary in my plan for mankind, as there cannot be one without the other. There are no hills without valleys, no mountains without canyons.

“To this end, I created cancer. It is one of my proudest creations, right along with the brain and daylight. It is as necessary for your world as love and understanding, hate and despair, and hot and cold. Cancer allows me to strike down the mighty or the weak, the bold and the meek, at anytime I see fit.

“The reason I am here today is that my creation is being threatened, and you have been chosen to alleviate this threat as a service to your Creator.

“There are three children, aged 3, 5 and 6. These children will grow to adulthood and attend the same University, be on the same research team, and will stumble upon the key to, and the cure for, most of the cancers that plague humanity. 85% of the cancers will be almost immediately curable, then, within 20 years from their discovery, cancer will be completely wiped out. Cancer will no longer be known to mankind, other than as a curiosity tucked within the history books. This cannot happen yet.”

Allah then places both hands on the table, palms up. Suddenly there appears a dagger in his hands.

“This is the blessed dagger which you will use to complete your mission. It will protect you from discovery or capture until this task is completed. It does not matter where you are when you perform the tasks, you will be completely impervious until the final task of the mission is completed.

“You are to go to these three children and cut their throats. You are to remain with them and watch them bleed out until you are absolutely sure that they are dead. This must be performed within 21 days of today, and must be performed in the manner I have described to you, for reasons that are my own and must not be questioned.

“After the final child has been sacrificed, you will be captured, prosecuted, and after 12 years in prison, you will be put to death via lethal injection. Nobody will ever believe that you spoke to Allah, and you will go to your grave known as a child killer.

“When you enter my Kingdom, however, you will have a special place at my right hand for all eternity, among the others who have been martyred for my Word. You are not the first, and you will not be the last, who has sacrificed himself for me.

“If you refuse this mission, you will not be looked upon favorably on the Day of Judgment.

“There will be no further explanations; there will be no more questions. What is your answer?”


Question: Would you perform the mission as commanded by Allah? Please, yes or no, followed by your explanation.

The gods are warring for the hearts and minds of the human race.

The religions themselves are memetic nets designed to catch the populace.

The god of a religious man is as real to them as your personal reality is to you.

The gods of each religious person are as real to them as they are false to those that don't belive them.

I waited about two weeks and then felt fine, and went for a run (about 6 miles... i cant help myself, it too fun barefoot). But it was about two miles too long. my shins felt fine until the last two miles and I should have just stopped and didn't.

since then I've been in pretty ridiculous pain. I finally started wearing three layers of high socks and rubbing tiger balm on the shin - dont know if this is helping.

it seems that its gotten a little better. I can walk between 10 and 100 metres with no pain at all. Then it starts to hurt. it seems if i walk right the pain goes away, and if i walk wrong its almost impossible to stop the pain.

This morning I received a message from the vice president promoting the ""caving in"" to republicans on the tax extension for the top two percent of the richest Americans. He conveniently forgot to mention the compromise will:

* Create an additional 700 billion dollars to the deficit.
* The unemployment extension will run out just as the presidential campaign starts to heat up, giving republicans ammunition for the fight; it's going to be real nasty this time around thanks to citizen united.

The president should back out of this compromise, let it fail, and then blame the republicans for its failure. The republicans have been responsible for this mess since the very beginning! The president needs to stop reaching across the isle with an olive branch and instead reach across the isle an ass kicking. We will stand behind him if he simply starts acting like FDR instead of Bill Clinton! 

I am getting tired of seeing the president support republican policies; we elected him for __CHANGE__, giving tax breaks to the richest Americans, damaging Social Security, and lowering the estate tax, so that he can get 13 months of unemployment is not change!

But, you see, KDevelop 4.1 is not compatible with KDE 4.6.
My gripe here is the deb package system has an insanely powerfull dependency system, and the team who made these packages did not think it could be nice to use it to uninstall KDevelop when installing these beta packages.

No, they think a [note on the website](http://www.kubuntu.org/news/kde-sc-4.6-beta-2) is enough.

Look at this latest tidbit today: The US and China [colluded to derail negotiations](http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,733630,00.html) at the climate conference in Copenhagen last year. That's huge. And this is just one of 250,000 stories.  The big stories are coming out so quickly in fact, that many of them are getting lost in the noise.

2.  Wikileaks has revealed for the first time in recent history, just how different the world presented by the media and the real world truly are.  Yeah, we all suspected this stuff, but now its sitting there in plain sight.  That's *huge*. Don't downplay it.

3. Because of these events, we're now witnessing sustained ""cyberwarfare"" (God I hate that term...there's gotta be a better way to say that) between the established order, and those that want to see information free. I don't think this is going to go away anytime soon; rather I think its an early sign of things to come.

Remember that line about how ""9/11 changed everything""? Maybe so, but this is right up there too.  I feel like we're witnessing another global paradigm shift.

**TL;DR Don't downplay Cablegate just because you're sick of hearing about it on Reddit. This is a really, really, really big deal.**

**EDIT**: Many of you have pointed out that the actual number of stories revealed by the leaked cables is much less than 250,000, as the contents of many of the cables are mundane.  While this may be true, even if a couple dozen huge stories come out of this, that's still quite a bit, considering we'd be talking about each one for a week if it came out at any other time.  I still maintain points #2 and #3.

The game has some hard levels (currently on Chapter 5 which has a few frustrating parts) and I find it really enjoyable. The characters are nice seeing from other games i've played (""the kid"", ""N-game ninja"", ""minecrafter"", ""headcrab/lamarr"" for example) and it's an awesome game so far seeing all these warp zones, the ""negative levels"" makes it quite interesting (like a meat boy, bandage girl and fetus boy wasn't enough to make it interesting). It can be frustrating to restart from start everytime you die (most annoying are the warpzones where you have to complete 3 levels on 3 lives (for each level). If you don't you have to restart from the first level and continue on which is annoying seeing all the stuff delaying til' you can actually replay (back to map, see warpzone video, video for warpzone, lives and level screen)), but that just adds more *fun* to it, you will feel awesome when you've finished a hard level. :D

87282,"I don't know where I stand on the political spectrum.

- **I believe the mentally ill and mentally retarded should be institutionalized.** Mostly the ones that need constant care and cant even figure out their are alive.

It is a sad fact that there are people collecting loads in disability for their adult relatives with retardation like down-syndrome where they can not be functional in society. Also, many mentally ill people on the governments dime getting thousands and thousands in medication and they are still hardly functional and need almost constant care. I'm not saying everyone who falls below an IQ of 70 cannot function. My ex is retarded, but good enough to have a drivers license and be a very productive hard laborer. He can function will little help from others. Im talking about people who sit around and drool all day and squeal. Centralizing their care in institutions may be cheaper. Im also not saying just because someone has depression that they are a waste. No, I'm talking more about insane people. If the family wants them, the family gets them. But no government aid. Its a waste.

- **Retirement age should be based on your career or how badly your body is aged.**

My father, hes never been to bright, ill admit, the man dropped out of school in 7th grade when he was 16. But he now is a very well known and valuable asset to the company he works for. He is a propane delivery truck driver. He is an excellent driver and by some miracle he passes his written tests every 3 years (there's so much junk about other substances he never transports its insane). His body, as determined by doctors is worn right away. He has not a strip of cartilage left in his shoulders or knees from working so hard his whole life, and he is only 58. Doctors push him to quit and try to get disability before he kills himself, but he, or me, doesn't know how he will be able to eat or pay bills for the 1 to 2 years it will be before he starts seeing a check *if* he can get approved. Then there is people like my grandma (rest her soul) she was in great shape. Healthy as an ox into her 80's she was sharp as a tack and cleaned houses for extra money. I'm not saying that she shouldn't have been able to retire briefcase she was healthy, but she defiantly would have had no physical or mental issues holding one down right on into her 70s. She worked until her very last years. I'm just saying 65 is a death sentence for some people.

- **affordable health insurance for all is good.** So long as it helps you get back to work.

As a sick person myself I think it is good for everyone to have the opportunity for good health. I was stricken with some type of illness that the doctors could not figure out what it was before I was so sick and could not work I got fired. Still sick. I need one operation to determine the problem and when they do, more than likely a little treatment and boom! I'm back to work. If not? Oh well, Im screwed. But im not gonna sit on my ass collecting something I never worked for. Im young and sick. Not old and worked 35, 40 years and then sick. I don't deserve it. I hate sitting here doing nothing all day. Not to mention relying of friends that know how sick I am and throw me some money for bills so I'm not homeless again. Young people like me who are sick and will always be sickly? Goes back the the first thing kinda, institutionalize the hopeless ones. I am not a hopeless case. Even If I never get the operation I need I can still work, just not on a schedule. I fix peoples computers for extra money too. I can do that. If I start getting in pain I stop and go lay down for a few hours. A job? The nail in my coffin is always telling them ""hey, i get violently ill sometimes, and when I do its sudden and everything stops right there."" and they point me out the door. I am not ""reliable"" in my condition in any way. But I can still do small things to be productive, like many in my case. Temporary insurance for the sick is a good thing. Once they are determined to be better and have no problems, cut them right off. Go work for insurance. The insurance should not have a ridiculously high deductible too. I knew what procedure I needed in my final month of working but the deducible was $2,000. WAY out of my reach. Hospitals would not take a payment plan citing that people who have such high deductible usually don't pay.

87852,"I'm having coffee with my ex today.

We broke up ~2 months ago (anyone remember the ""Help! My ex is coming over for what I think is the ""talk"" What should I do?"")

We haven't talked since.

I really love her, I don't know If I could get her back.. and If I could.. I don't know if I would... ( I don't want her to have to deal with my bullshit) This is actually pretty good for me(writing that is) so I think I'm going to continue.

So, I love her, and we are extremely compatible, and shes just as weird as me, and just as ambitious, and more successful(not a bad thing).

I often don't know if, I still think she's apart of my life, and I just haven't acknowledged her going, or if I am really ""ok"" with it.. or I don't even know.

At times I'm happy being ""independent"" able to ""date"" etc.. but mostly, I just miss her, and doing activities with her. Plus, after her, every girl pales in comparison.

The relationship fell apart, due to me, I had a kinda crazy job over the summer, and was away, and secondly... I didn't really have a full time job when I got back... If I'm not working as much as I like to ( I like super busy, industrious days) I get sad, and not happy with myself. If I'm not happy with myself, I start doubting my relationships.
One of the saddest parts about the whole thing going down... was I had really been looking forward to hanging out with her that night, and getting some snuggies in...

What ended up happening, is she found my reddit[old] account( I was frequently on it, when i was at her place) and when I was new on reddit(in august) I had posed a question about our relationship... ( I also posted a picture of her, I didn't know how these things worked back then! ) I wasn't aware of making throw away accounts, and I ended up forgetting about it... The topic of the thread was, should I break up with my GF. (or something along those lines) I ended up coming to the conclusion, that if I felt that our relationship had soured after a month of me being back, I would end it. ( I didn't, I was happy to be with her again) She ended up finding my thread... and well was not very impressed with me posting an image of her (in a bikini, it was as an incentive to get some responses back, like I said, I WAS NEW TO REDDIT) She's a very private girl. On facebook you can't see any of her pictures etc etc. so this obviously bothered her.

So I'm not exactly sure what else she might of found(not that it was bad) but I don't really know what or anything....

So she might have been mad, and sad at the same time finding these things for two reasons 1) it affirmed her doubts that she was having about me in the relationship, and 2) it was in a very public setting, reddit.
I see asking reddit, as a way of asking a bunch of anonymous friends that won't ever come into play in any ongoing or future relationships(not meant as offensive) I see them as being more objective than asking any of my friends that actually know both parties (like if she asked any of her friends what to do in this context, I feel is MORE of an invasion)

So I don't know.. we are having coffee... and exchanging some articles clothing etc that was left at each others respective places... I'm not sure if I'm going to ask to try and work on us, or, if I'm just going to bite the bullet, and not put her through more of my... bs.

She suggested coffee. I think that she is going into this as a closure thing... so.. ya.. Don't know what to do.... uhg.",1,-1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-1,-1,-1,0,-1,-1,0,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-1,-1,-1,0,-1,-1,0,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1

I *think* I'm fairly popular at work but I also have a few colleagues that seems to be two faced and are more than happy to backstab or bully me. I've tried different ways working with them but it hasn't changed their attitude towards me much. I keep telling myself this is the norm everywhere but it is affecting me emotionally and causing me great stress. I usually go home with tears in my eyes and when I get home I just collapse onto my bed. I have insomnia or rage so I don't sleep that well.

I've tried doing exercise but that actually makes it worse because my testosterone goes through the roof and today I nearly had a break down when I became the scapegoat for things I'm not even involved.

My boss knows about it and says he really understand and is trying to change the work ethos, but I hate to say he is a wuss and bows down to bullies too. 

I've a fairly well paid position and I believe I'm great at my job. When our department is short staffed or the workload is high, I'm the only one that comes in to work for free over the weekends. I make sure everything is running smoothly and all the deadlines are met. I've completed projects that are not my responsibility and yet my colleague have the guts in the meeting to boast about how well they have done it even though they were not involved or have any idea of what was done.

I want to look for a new job but at the same time I think the problem is not the job and is me, I'm too submissive and this will happen to me anywhere I go. I've tried hard to change my personality but it is just me and I don't know how to be firm or even say no to people.

Assange was wearing a grey prison tracksuit because he did not have three of his own outfits, a requirement for prisoners to wear their own clothes.

&gt;Assange, who is being held in a single cell in the prison's segregation unit, complained about the daytime television, Stephens said: ""he doesn't have access to a computer, even without an internet connection, or to writing material. He's got some files but doesn't have any paper to write on and put in them.""

&gt;Stephens was accompanied by Jennifer Robinson, another solicitor, and his barrister Geoffrey Robertson.

89045,"Ok, so we all like FPS's they are wonderful games and some of us exclusively play games within this genre. Rarely stepping out of the comfortable realm of that oh so familiar firearm angled out of the corner of the screen. I have these two ideas that I think should be, in some way, integrated into the FPS genre. 

""Glance-Back"": Are you ever walking down a valley when out of no where you are knifed by an op-for. My reaction is usually: ""I knew I should have been checking my back more"". My proposed solution would be designating a button (or multiple buttons in unison) to a quick look over the shoulder. FOV was only about 3/4 of what you would normally see (look over your shoulder right now to get an idea of what i mean) it would be a great advantage when moving through enemy territory. This is already available when using most vehicles withing games such as Battlefield: Bad Company 2, which in my opinion isn't plausible at all. When was the last time you got out of your vehicle and climbed onto the hood to see how many Apaches were chasing you?

Dive: Once again strolling through an enemy village you find that shots  have been fired on you and decide that a quick strafe left or right will save you. No, you are dead, that was a dream. Actions like diving or rolling are common in many third-person games. Your avatar has the ability to dive quickly to the left or right to avoid oncoming demons, ogres, frag grenades, or the ever so familiar bullet fire. Yet we don't have this ability in FPS games. Once again I propose that developers work in a dive option. At first this may sound like a huge advantage for the person being fired on, allowing them to quickly dive behind cover and shoot you in the face. However, if implemented properly the attackee would only have a split second to react in this manner and put them out of danger for a split second. So if you are walking at your enemy and laying down fire then they will more than likely not have time to react. If you hare burst firing from mid - long range than it may give the attacked time to move outta the way, regain health and continue their stroll.

Tell me what you think guys...maybe I'm just not that good.

90849,"Alright, I have a Dell XT2, it only has 1GB of Wonder RAM, but since it is DDR3 and not DDR2, my old ram from my XT won't work. I won't really have the funds to buy new ram until well after the new year. So I was wondering if anyone had any ideas on how to streamline the system to at least run reddit. As of now, if I go to load any thread, FF locks up and no longer responds for a few moments. The same thing with Word or OneNote, as those take a while to load. It makes taking notes in class an experience. 

The full system specs are this.. 

Dell XT2
Intel Core 2 Dou 1.4GHZ
1GB (on board, their is none located in the RAM slot) 
Win7 Ult - 32 - I bought, because the XT came with Vista. I was not a fan. The new XT2 also came with Vista. I also still have a copy of Widows XP Tablet PC ed. that was on an old Gateway Tablet that I had for 2 odd years. 
N-Trig Digitizer with Pen and Touch 


The XT I had before Dell replaced it with my current XT2, had 3GB of RAM. I had went out and bought a 2GB stick. The XT came with 2GB of RAM, one on board, one in the slot. I guess, when they replaced my XT with the XT2, they forgot the other 1GB of RAM. I'm not really bitching, they replaced an old computer with a brand new one.  

Well I'm open to any idea that may or may not work. I have my last tomorrow.. so if I screw something up, no real big problem with reformatting. ",-1,-1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-1,-1,-1,0,-1,-1,0,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-1,-1,-1,0,-1,-1,0,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1

90899,"This past year has been the worst of my life. I'm a male in my younger twenties. Two years ago things were going great for me. I was doing what I wanted to do for a living, making decent money for my age and just able to enjoy life. Of course good things cant last forever and the economy left me jobless.

The next years consisted of me working bottom of the barrel jobs to scrap by. Finally found my way into a decent job to only be laid off again almost a year ago. At this point my depression and anxiety has hit rock bottom and I can't even bring myself to keep working these shit jobs.

During that time the only thing that kept me going was my girlfriend at the time. She is the only person I have ever loved and cared about. She stayed with me through thick and thin. She broke up with me three months ago. I honestly don't even know why we broke. We were both just in a bad place and called it quits.

I about a month and a half after we broke up I didn't think I could do it anymore. I couldn't stand feeling like this. I found myself at her door crying, pleading for some sort of help. I was out of control, I had never felt this bad before, I didn't know how to handle myself. The night ended with her calling the cops for my own safety. I spent the night in a crisis center. A day or two following I found myself slapped with an order of protection against her.

Initially, I was okay for a while. I felt like I was finally getting an opportunity for things to get better. I've had untreated depression my whole life. I imagined the possibility of going to day to day without this feeling dragging me down.

That was great until I actually sought treatment. The realization of how convoluted the system is slowly brought me back down. It's been weeks since I've tried to get help and the soonest a psychiatrist can see me isn't until January. I have a meeting with a counselor next week, but am not particularly expecting great result from that.

Simply put, I don't know if I can make it. Everyday this past month has been more and more of a struggle for me. I'm not sure how much longer I'm going to be able to hang in there. Especially now that the school semester is over, I have nothing but time to dwell in my thoughts. My brain is my enemy. I just want it to stop. I don't want to exist anymore.

91143,"The past couple months I went through the worst depression of my life. No event really caused it; I think it was just my body reacting to stopping long-term use of weed &amp; alcohol. In the process, I dropped off the face of the earth, stopped answering my phone, seeing my friends, and posting on facebook. I withdrew completely...I just totally lost my will to do anything. I became like a zombie, sleeping the vast majority of every day away.

At some point, I realized I needed help, applied for medicaid, and started seeing a psychiatrist. I'm still waiting on my official diagnosis &amp; prescription meeting, but it's looking like Bipolar type II (I'm going to be vying for lithium and wellbutrin).

I always hate when I get blindsided like that and I can't think of a response until later. This is not one of those times. I say ""yeah, well sandwiched around two numbers on either side, knowing that it's a zip code, and seeing the zip code in front of you might've been clues that I actually meant zero when I said O.""  He goes on to explain to me how O is an ambiguous definition and needs further clarification. Not for zip codes at Dominoes, my good sir. Not at dominoes.

93332,"I had two different groups today for Stonecore.

The first was great.  After the first couple pulls, I told them it would probably be necessary for me to drink pretty often.  The tank said np, and actually reminded me to drink a couple of times.  Healing now is pretty strained now as it usually is when making the necessary gear jump, and the first group understood pretty well.  We finished with a couple of minor hiccups.

The second was terrible.  We wiped on the first pull, then I got bitched out for not healing.  The next few pulls the group just ran around like its heroic UK or something.  I was draining mana and poppings CDs on every pull.  We wiped on the first boss and I get bitched out again.  

Although not usually as bad, groups like the latter are more frequent.

The basic tactic in the game has been lost on a generation of players I think.  The tank is literally the only member who is supposed to get hit (other than incidental damage).  Adherence to this tactic was once critical and is becoming that way again.  When shit got easier, healers healed the group, cause what the hell why not.  Now, it seems, that the group *relies* on group heals.

Exacerbating the problem is that there is no benchmark for a decent healer.  People judge the quality of healing as whether they die or not.  No one (usually) goes into a fight thinking, ""hmmm, the healer should hit about XXXXXXXX HP healed this fight.  Moreover, since there is only one healer in 5s, there is no one to measure up against.

Back in the day the healer would have some power in a group.  DPS would apologize for pulling, tanks would apologize for not picking up an add and what not.  These days, it seems that if someone dies, it was the healers fault.

I know most people who play now, did not spend months getting to 60 when every instance relied on the tactic outlined above.  And the expansion is new so people are getting used the increased difficulty.  But, contrary to popular opinion, its not always the healers fault.


OK I feel better now :)

** Edit **

Thanks for the support dudes (and possibly ladies)!  I should note that I do enjoy the challenge now, healers should eventually run out of mana.  Also, all my tools are finally being utilized, which I like.  The game is much more interesting now.  Also questing is super fun too.

My problem is just that people tend to blame healers, no more than ever, for their own lack of skill.  And if I do my job too well they will never get it.

After a couple of days she tells me I should go visit her sometime. She's pretty, funny, and (apparently) has all the stuff I look for in women (note that I have no problem speaking to women or getting any, but usually that ends up being a fling or a ONS).

Anyhow, I head over to her house yesterday. I literally fight my way through a snowstorm to get there. We're both a bit sick. We have a few drinks, and her flatmate won't leave us alone. They both study medicine and spent a shit load of time talking about medical stuff that I have absolutely no clue about. Finally, about an hour before I leave the flatmate goes to bed. So far everything has been okay. We talk for another 30 mins, then decide to light up a joint. She got up after that and literally passed out. She like just fell over and landed below the kitchen table. I'm thinking ""What the..."" so I try to get her up but she wasn't very responsive. Anyway, apparently she blacked out, tells me she just needs to lie down on the floor for a bit and she's fine. So we both lie beneath the kitchen table and I'm caressing her arms. Around 11.30pm I left because she had to get up 7. All in all I didn't have the feeling that she's very interested (we got along awesome before I went over). Then again she once mentioned she's usually not very nice to guys at the beginning. 

It didn't much feel like a date at all. I felt a bit cornered by her and her flatmate talking all the time about shit I didn't know. I told her before I left how I felt; that I thought she was cool and she was pretty, but that I didn't know her and would like to get to know her better. She agreed.

Thing is, I asked her why she was single and she told me she was sick and fed up with men. She said she doesn't want a relationship, and blablabla but can't help it if she fell in love. I asked her what that meant later she said ""she isn't ruling anything out.""

According to my standards, I failed miserably that date, which is tearing me up. We agreed to meet on Monday, but that we'd stay in touch until then. 

What the eff do I do now? I can't help but obsess about it somehow. Spent all night thinking about it, and it was the first thing I thought about this morning. I wanted to go ice-skating, but that's only Sundays. Do I call her before Monday or wait till I meet her online?

 The painting is for my Art 20 IB course, though it is not an actual assignment since this course is very lenient about independent work (basically I can do whatever I want as long as I’m actually learning).
*****
Here is an explanation of the symbols used:

**Center person:** Me.

**Girl and guy:** Other bisexuals. My attraction to both men and women. Strength. Comfort in the thought that there are others like me.

**Walking forward/away from crowds:** Not ignoring them, but rejecting their beliefs and not letting them “get to you”

**Left crowd:** LGBT who are non-supportive of bisexuals

**Burning flag:** misrepresentation of LGBT values

**Right crowd:** non-allied and religious community who are non-supportive of bisexuals.

**Burning cross:** misrepresentation of values taught by Jesus (“love everyone”). Using religion as a scapegoat for discrimination and hate.

**Clouds:** My agnosticism. How people try to force their religion on others when they have no proof of anything. How we must take accountability for our own actions without saying they’re from God because we can’t know if there is one or what that God would be like.

**Light (from the bottom):** A better future. Acceptance from self and from others.

So basically it is a coming out story, social commentary, and hope for a better future all wrapped into one.

I have an interest in becoming a game designer. I've worked on MUDs for almost fifteen years, as a builder, scripter, and currently I am designing a new combat system. I really enjoy this as a hobby, and I wanted to pursue game design as a future career. 

I found a great program at Ft Lauderdale's Art Institute, but it's 90k for a three year program. I was wondering if anyone could give me some advice on whether it is worth it to go to a school that specializes in game design or if it would be better to get a broader degree at a university (and if so, what kind of program would be best?)

I am asking this question because the Art Institute has gotten so-so reviews (I searched the internet for people's experiences) and the company that does the most hiring (Electronic Arts) just had a class action lawsuit against them because of overworking salaried employees. I am worried about going through an expensive program and getting a crappy job. 

I would really appreciate any information you would be willing to share. Also, I want to work as a designer, designing levels, balancing combat, writing storylines, scripting quests, etc, I don't want to be an animator.

anti-tank missiles Sweden sold to Venezuela in 1988 ended up
in FARC stocks.

&gt;--Diversion of conventional weapons, including MANPADS, to
terrorist and criminal organizations, such as the FARC,
presents a clear threat to peace and security in Latin
America.

If arms are transferred to Venezuela, we ask that EU Member
States work to strengthen transparency and accountability
measures for such exports, such as through post-shipment
verification to ensure that the arms remain in Venezuelan
hands.

&gt;-- We are aware of and appreciate EU efforts to strengthen
transparency and accountability via its Code of Conduct.

&gt;--We encourage Sweden, in its capacity as EU President, to
raise further awareness of this matter within the EU and
through multilateral export-control mechanisms.

&gt;--To that end, we urge Sweden to present a paper on the
illegal transfer of Swedish arms from Venezuelan stocks, as
well as Sweden's view of arms transfers to Venezuela, at the
Wassenaar General Working Group in October.

&gt;-- We would also urge you to raise these transfers with the
Russian government. The United States has raised concerns
with Russia about arms transfers to Venezuela. Sharing your
experiences with the Russian government may encourage them to
ensure that their weapons are not diverted.

**If asked about U.S. arms sales to Venezuela:**

They almost always seem to lack the ability to hold a meaningful conversation and just blurt out the most random shit to make them seem like they're in some non existent ""in"" crowd. One example of this happened today.

I had bummed a cigarette from one girl while I was on my break at work and I noticed this particular brand of smokes were quite a bit shorter than most cigarettes. I quickly remembered a former boss I had who smoked something similar, 72s, so I asked the girl if that's what they were just to start some friendly small talk. However, her response wasn't the expected, ""Yeah, I prefer smoking smaller amounts at a time,"" or something else a bit more logical, Instead it was, ""Yeah, they're cheap, I feel like I should light up two at a time though."" At this point I looked at her, smiled, and raised an eyebrow all the while wondering if she was being intentionally ironic or if she was genuinely stupid. As the conversation began to lull, I started getting distracted by some construction happening nearby. I decided to keep the conversation going, because there's nothing more painful that awkward silence. I pointed over to the work being done and inquired what they were doing. She then paused and said one of the most non sequitur and retarded things I have ever heard, ""I like to buy my clothes at resell shops."" Now this statement by itself isn't all that stupid, I'd even agree with it, as I like to shop at thrift stores as well. However, at this point I realized the girl must have caught on to my Ray Ban frames (prescription), skinny jeans, worn out thrift store jacket, androgynous haircut and graphic tee. On this current day, it was very obvious, my hipster was showing and this girl was trying to impress me with her ""cred"". She then began to go onto a spiel about how she doesn't like spending very much money, how she usually makes her own clothes, and how The Clash is one of the most inspiring bands of all time. I quickly find out I'm very similar to this girl in many ways. We're both frugal with our money, we both like being crafty in ways to help us save more, and we like old school punk rock (clearly her more than me.) However none of this seemed to matter. The fact that this girl, instead of keeping the conversation light as I enjoyed the mooched cigarette I received from her, had to go ahead and practically say ""Hey, look at me, I'm hip too!"" To top it all off, as I was leaving I decided it would be polite to ask this girl her name. She told me hers, I told her mine, and them her final words to me were, ""What's your sign?"" I answered and walked away only to think ""What the fuck? My sign?""

Another bit i remember somewhere before that was this woman was at a party, and it was just loads of pervy men.. i think she was a prostitute?

96408,"**I'm putting this up concerning an incident a friend went through recently.**

""...At 3:30, I pick up my mail and note that I have a package waiting at security. This is standard operating procedures for my condo. Security signs for packages. I actually had 3 packages. One package consisted of two CZ858s rifles (one restricted, one non-restricted) and two individual crates of 7.62x39. Although the CZs were discretely packaged, the ammo was not.

When I pick up the packages, the security officer (an older gentleman - perhaps in his 50's) said, ""Oh, your the one with the rifles and ammo"". I didn't really respond to this. He then stated, ""Well, I hope you don't plan on keeping this stuff here"". I responded, ""Why not""? His answer, ""I DON'T WANT TO SEE ANYBODY GET SHOT"". I attempted to reassure him that I would be the last person to worry about going on a rampage.

I then took all my packages up to my condo (encountered absolutely nobody along the way), opened up the rifle boxes, cleaned them, trigger locked the non-restricted and properly secured the restricted. I then broke down the cardboard boxes (which only said ""CZ"" on them as well as had a little sticker which said ""858-2"" and ""858-4"". I also removed any identifying names (mine) from the packages and placed them in the recycling bin.

Skip forward to 9:10pm. My wife returns from her Pilates class and finds several uniformed police officers gathered in the elevator area on my floor. They ask her where she is going and when she tells them, they frantically call their superiors and state ""We have the wife right here"". They ask her whether I'm home and she tells them that she isn't 100% certain. Guessing that it is something firearms related, and knowing what kind of fishing expeditions happen with inspections, she refuses multiple requests to enter with her, and she also refuses to leave the door open. She then tells me what she encountered and then I wait. For approximately 20 minutes, nothing happens. I am able to note 4 marked police cruisers and one unmarked are waiting downstairs (isn't technology wonderful). I then see an officer with the rifle boxes place them in the trunk of one of the cruisers. Figuring they weren't going away, and knowing I did nothing wrong, and wanting to get some sleep, I call 22 division and tell them that I wanted somebody from the crew down there to call me.

About two minutes later, I do receive the call. Basically the sergeant tells me that they received a call and found my two boxes. He tells me that her knows that I am a legal firearms owner and that he has checked the system and sees that the non-restricted CZ is registered to me, but that the restricted is not. He says that he wants to come and inspect the firearm, the certificate and the storage. When I asked him whether they had a warrant, he responded that they DID NOT. I told the sergeant that I do have a certificate and that he should be calling the CFC which would certainly be able to prove it's worth the billions of dollars we have poured into it. He again explains that it isn't in the system and that he needs to come and check. I then ask him, ""What law do you think I have violated"", to which he responds, ""That's what we are trying to determine"". I end the conversation with ""I'm sorry, without a warrant, you will not be entering my suite, and I will not help you with your fishing expedition"". At this point, I believe that the sergeant lost cell phone reception (happens often on the ground floor) since the conversation ended mid sentence.

I then get my notice of transfer out to get the registration certificate number and wait for a call back. After about five minutes of no call, I contact 22 division again and ask that the sergeant call me back so I can forward him my certificate number and end this fiasco of wasted time and resources. A couple of minutes later, I get the know at the door. From this point, here's the conversation as I remember it (Me = Me, Him = Detective Constable with the Guns and Gang Squad)

KNOCK KNOCK
Me: Who is it?
Him: Toronto Police

Me: OK
Pause...

Him: Can you open the door?
Me: I'm sorry, it's late, I'm not feeling well, and I'm not decent.

Him: Can you go throw some clothes on so you can open the door?
Me: It's my house and I elect not to.

Him: It's kind of awkward speaking through the door.
Me: Sorry, but if you want to speak with me, it will have to be this way.

At this point, he goes over the same story that the sergeant did over the phone about the restricted rifle not being in the system and that he wanted to enter to check it's legitimacy.

Me: Why don't you call the CFC?
Him: Well, our computers say it's not on there.

Me: Call the CFC. They exist for reasons just like this.
Him: Well why don't you open up. We can just check.

Me: Do you have a warrant?
Him: No.

Me: Without a warrant, you WILL NOT be entering.
Him: If you have nothing to hide, you should have no problem with us coming to check.

Me: Because I have nothing to hide is exactly why you have no reason to come inside.
Pause

Him: Listen, we have a report dealing with firearms. We're not just going to go away.
Me: That's great, but I'm not opening my door. I have broken no laws. I have done nothing wrong.

Him: Just open the door and show us your certificate, and this will all be over.
Me: I'm not opening the door, but I'd like to help you, so why don't I just read you the certificate number and you can call the CFC and they'll confirm everything is OK.

This little bit of the conversation repeats over and over again. The officer does not want to accept the number, insisting on physically checking the paperwork and storage.

Him: I'm going to note in my report that you are being uncooperative. This won't fare well for you.
Me: I am attempting to assist you, but you are insisting on violating my Charter Rights and illegally entering.

Him: Which Charter Right is that?
Me: Section 6 (I have learned this little misinformation trick from the Police themselves in the past. It is a fine way of testing their knowledge of the situation).

Pause...
Pause... They don't realize that section 6 doesn't apply, because their knowledge of the Charter is limited. Rookie mistake.

Him: So are you telling me that you are not going to cooperate.
Me: I'm attempting to help you out by giving you the certificate number, which is as good as the certificate itself, but you won't take it.

Him: When my report goes to the CFO and shows you aren't cooperating, it will affect your ability to renew you license.
Me: How about I scan a copy of my certificate and email it to your division.

Him: We're not equipped to deal with that. (Are they really so cash strapped that they have no email)
Me: Well then I can't help you.

Him: I know you have the firearm, I need to see the certificate.
Me: I have the certificate, everything is legitimate.

Him: So you admit you have the rifle.
Me: I'm not answering any more of your questions. Without a warrant, you are not entering. I've tried to assist you, but you won't listen.

Him: Good night.
Me: Good night.

This ended the events for the night. 

The next day, I contacted the CFOs office and requested that they confirm that the registration certificate was indeed on the system. Not only was it there, it was the first firearm that comes up. I explained the story and she was sympathetic and confirmed that I acted well within my rights and that the officer should have had access to the information from his computer. I told her my concerns about the officers threats that there would be license renewal problems and she reassured me that she would take it up with the boss and make sure that it didn't happen.

Immediately following this conversation, I contacted the Guns and Gangs task force. A representative told me the following:

Currently, the Task Force has engaged in a large scale operation involving the expired PALs of Toronto as well as unregistered firearms. I was not on any such list. She also confirmed that my restricted CZ was on the computer system, but that the CPIC version may not have been updated (Note: The firearms was entered on the system on the 13th, and the incident occurred on the 19th. Can such discrepancies really exist?). She stated that there is no criminal investigation involving me, and that I have appeared to be complying with all regulations. There will be no escalation of this issue to the CFO and I have nothing to worry about.""

I know that there are thread currently about searches and speaking with police. The above could fit nicely in either spot. Legal gun owners should know that they can stand up for their rights without fear. I stood up to the task force specifically attempting to confiscate firearms, and survived. They can too. I've preached it several times in those threads, and it holds true:

NO WARRANT, NO ENTRY!!!

I'd be the first to admit that OCD has its humorous aspects--back when my contamination fears were bad, I learned how to turn off the faucet and open the door with my feet.  I could even manage a door knob with my shoes on.

Now--quirks could very well be OCD, but it trivializes the disease and makes light of how severe it can actually be.

Ask me almost anything.  I've experienced crippling contamination fears and even worse intrusive thoughts, but, fortunately, special therapy and hard work has allowed me to learn how to cope with the OCD and live relatively symptom free.

To preface any questions--contamination fears are more common with OCD and more 'acceptable,' meaning you can approach many 'regular' therapists about them.  Intrusive thoughts, on the other hand, are the kind of OCD symptom that can often go undiagnosed because the victim is afraid of telling, or misdiagnosed because some doctor didn't recognize the disease.

'Intrusive thoughts' are best described [in this article by my therapist](http://www.behaviortherapycenter.com/BehaviorTherapyCenter/Tormenting_Thoughts.html) -- thoughts are unwanted and usually of a violent and/or sexual nature.

(I know DEs conflict, but I don't use one, so I don't really want to talk about it)

I enjoy Linux. I enjoy using it, I enjoy feeling that I can modify it. I have had problems with audio, graphics and Qt/GTK+.

I don't use Windows anymore and where it once stood on my hard drive has been flattened and empty) usually grab the mouse and block WM hotkeys. I have an ATI Radeon 4890 HD and it takes a bit to get the graphics working.

But I've NEVER regretted using Linux over Windows despite these problems (I haven't used Mac OS X). I'm not ignoring that they exist (and are in most cases fixable with some terminal magic), but the benefits outweigh the problems. It's open, free as in speech, easy to tinker with, has fairly good pure 64bit support, package managers, community, not monopolizing the desktop market, not selling antennas that don't work properly, things like that.
Despite all this, I'm sure Linux will pull through and make it as an OS. It may be faith biased or just me being bias in my own head.

Here's some background information: Sometimes my Grandfather will say/do things that are irritating or dumb, but my family just shrugs them off because we think he just gets easily confused or just doesn't pay much attention to things. My Mother came up with the idea that he can't possibly be that confused and that he is really doing these things as pranks.


Here's the story:

Several years ago my family was at a restaurant. When we started to order, my Grandfather asked the waitress for poon tang (he was trying to order poutine). The waitress became red faced and asked him to clarify. He proceeded to act confused and order poon tang again. At this point my Father lost it and started laughing and my Grandmother clarified his order to the waitress. We all just assumed that he had no clue how to pronounce poutine and didn't know what poon tang was.



A little bit ago my Grandfather was talking to me and says, ""Remember when I asked that waitress for poon tang instead of poutine? The look on her face was great."" He knew what poon tang was and how to pronounce poutine. He managed to troll my family and some random waitress, and got away with it.


EDIT: Corrected spelling of 'poon tang', thanks SourCreamWater. 



EDIT: A second story of mine from the discussion, placing it here so people can see without going through comments.

When I was in the 2nd grade, my Grandfather heard that I was learning about the American Revolution. He told me a great family story that he thought should be shared with the class. I couldn't wait for school the next day to tell everyone!
The next day I went in to class and told the teacher I would like to share some family history with the class. I then stood up and related the story my Grandfather told me to share, ""My great, great, great, great, aunt was part of the Boston Tea Party... She was the last old bag they threw over.""

I usually can't come in any position other than when I'm on top (but I can get close, and it still feels really good). But when I'm on top, sometimes I can come 7 times in a span of 15 minutes or so, which is really awesome. But most times, I usually come at least 2-3 times in the 6 minutes or so that my boyfriend lasts. 
Now, masturbation seems like a whole different animal altogether. I've tried a couple times when I was a teen, didn't feel much, and then just gave up. My boyfriend rubs my clit before we have sex, but I usually tell him to stop because it feels too weird. The times I have masturbated by either rubbing my clit, or inserting my fingers, nothing really happens. I even have a Hitachi magic wand, and still nothing. However, two times when I have rubbed my clit a lot, I've felt a little, and then shot out something that smelled strongly of urine (so I'm thinking I peed). And even then, it didn't feel like much, not like the amazing orgasms that I get from sex. Can anyone shed some light on the situation?

TL;DR: I can only come from sex with my SO, and not masturbation, even though I've tried. ",1,-1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-1,-1,-1,0,-1,-1,0,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-1,-1,-1,0,-1,-1,0,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1

Fewer qualified people are enlisting forcing lowered standards for a job that rightfully should be for the ""best and brightest"". Recruiters are increasingly targeting disadvantaged minorities and young people from economically distressed areas. Incentive for service is no longer about idealism and become more out of socioeconomic necessity. I don't see any end to this madness until a cross section of our society is faced with a draft. Only then will we change our course. I believe these legislative acts only perpetuate a problem that eclipses both immigration reform and gay rights.

As for the repeal on ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell"", I completely and whole heartedly agree that men and women should have equal rights regardless of their sexual orientation and this would, of course, include military service. But, the motivation seems so suspect. When Joe Leiberman is behind it the bill has to be suspect.  I know it is a stereotype and can only speak to anecdotes, but every gay man or women I have met aren't the current norm for ""army material"". They are intelligent, compassionate, non-violent, creative, insightful, etc. Through the use of reverse psychology they have convinced an untold number of people that they want to enlist just because they can't. How many will enlist immediately following the repeal just because they can?

As for the Dream Act, it is known that it was partly crafted by the Pentagon. I feel the college aspect is highly over rated. In reality, this will be overwhelmingly be applied through military service. Is it really ethical to require young immigrants to be mercenaries as a path to citizenship? This seem all to familiar from empires of the past inscripting entire armies from outlying territories they conquered. We all know what happened to Rome when it became dependent on its conquered to conquer. Aren't hard working immigrants who mow lawns or build houses just as deserving as citizenship, or more so, than ones who are hired guns?

100261,"So, it's Burning Crusade all over again. UnPuGable content. I'm 0-22 in random heroics, in terms of completion, when not making a pre-made group of people I know.

It's doable content if you run with 4 other people, on vent, that you're sure are skilled and well read up on the content. If you can't put that together and are counting on the random finder to fill a group for you, you might as well unsubscribe now.

While I think that the Wrath model was far too easy, I think they've gone way to far in the other direction. Hard is good, but making all the content unPuGable isn't.

I don't want to have to find 4 competent friends and get on vent for what should be a 30-45 minute heroic random after work. I don't want to have to join a top tier raiding guild to clear normal mode entry-level content. Color me disappointed.

I feel 'faceroller tears' posts and comments are just a poor troll at a legitimate concern. /2 PuGs for raids? Even on the best realms that won't happen anymore. The heroic dungeon finder is dead in terms of making actual groups. Everything has to go through pre-made groups now, and if you want to raid you're going to be forced back into joining a raiding guild instead of picking up a random PuG in your free time. 

There are a lot of good players that don't have the schedule or resources to put things like this together, and they're going to be shut out, shit-out-of-luck in this xpac, regardless of their skill.

I think I'm a quality player, and in Wrath I exclusively PuG'd through Bane of the Fallen King and the ICC drakes. I PuG because I'm an adult with a career, friends, a full-time GF, and a social life. I want to be able to join a /2 PuG or just hit the random dungeon finder and have a reasonable chance of success. I can't commit to a raiding guild and often don't have the time after work to wait for 4 competent, geared friends to join vent and queue for a random heroic. While I agree the game needed to be made more difficult, this level of difficulty has killed the game for millions of PuGers who are good players, not just facerollers.

100518,"I've always wondered why the capping system was a flat-rate: 150 points per capture. Wouldn't it make more sense to award a variable number of points based on how much one contributed to the cap? For instance, if you sit there from start to finish, 150 points. If you come in when there flag is already half capped, 75 points. To combat the obvious--that point-scores in domination would almost always be lower--they could increase the points for a full flag cap. This would not only create incentive for playing the objectives, but would reduce the occurrences of the following obnoxious scenario:

Very often I will sit on a flag, capping, while my idiot teammate hides behind a box a few feet away, waiting out any possible explosives. Then, when the flag is almost completely capped, he will run around and snag himself 150 points. Very often, though, I will die before he runs over, and the flag will remain uncapped. And in almost all of those instances, we would have successfully capped the flag had he helped me from the beginning.

I am also surprised that there is not a point bonus for capping a flag by oneself. For as long as it takes one to sit on B-flag, out in the open, completely vulnerable to explosives and enemy fire, with no backup from teammates, it seems like you should get more than 150.

Does anyone know whether or not Treyarch has considered this, and what possible reasoning there would be for not implementing such a system?

**EDIT:** Please don't take this as another ""fucking noobs who don't play objectives in domination"" post. I know that pubs are filled with idiots--I've been playing FPS games since the first week Halflife 1 was released. I'm simply curious as to peoples' opinions on that possible change to the point system. Do people think this would be a good idea?

Ever since I was a little kid I always told myself I never wanted to be like them. That I'd be different. That'd I'd be great.

My older brother went the same road as them. He's only 24 and he's a college dropout and has to pay child support because he gave birth to a bastard child.

I'm almost 20 years old and I realize that I'm still just an average person, and it seems that nothing I do will matter. But most of all I fear that I'll end up like the rest of my family.

I always wanted to be something amazing as well as fall in love with someone amazing. But nobody that great will ever fall for just a tramp like me.

Perhaps I overvalue love(sex). Perhaps I'm a perfectionist who wants nothing but the best in his life. I'm afraid of ending up mediocre because I feel as though I have all this knowledge and that I have a responsibility to use that knowledge to give back to people/society.

Alas I digress.

So I think I have high standards, if not impossible standards for women.... They have to like me as more than just a friend. I'm 19 (20 in June) 6'2'', 295 lbs, stutter horribly, love heavy metal and reptiles (getting some venomous snakes in a few months), and even though I joke around about being ugly, I don't really think I'm that bad looking. The only relationship I was ever in was right after I was 16 and it only lasted 3 months, and she was cheating on me for the past 2 weeks or so.

Every now and then I keep thinking I'm a boarderline sex addict but then again I lost my virginity a year and a half ago and haven't had any since, so that's probably just normal, I dunno. Back in July this girl and I were talking about dating, met up, made out a while and I was completely happy to just stay there under that tree with her in my arms, I didn't feel the need for sex, even though I had her permission to do whatever I wanted with her, though in person I didn't really want to. Later I found out that she just wanted to cheat on her boyfriend and she was loose, thought I was a really nice guy and all, but I broke everything off due to legal complications, but afterwards I found out that her dad wanted us to date, so that situation was pretty messed up.

Most of my friends are girls my age, but no one has ever been intrested, but they all think I'm an amazing guy and all, and I suppose I am. One said that any girl would be lucky to have me as her boyfriend, but then she wouldn't go out with me, which doesn't make much sense, but whatever... Sure women say they like badboys, guitarists, stuff like that, but I've played guitar for 3 years, I'm decent at it, and I've done ""badboy"" things and all that, still nothing.

I woke up this morning, went hurrah and hurray when I checked the bank to make sure my paycheck deposited (I get paid on the 10th and the 26th of every month), and went off on my merry way to work. Not even an ear infection could get me down!! 

I rushed home at the end of the day to pick up my boyfriend, played the hero when it came to finding the paperwork that details our dental benefits for his upcoming appointment tomorrow, and we headed off merrily to make our purchases.

We stopped at the gaming store along the way, and selected our books with glee, then went to pay. After a little banter with our favorite gaming store clerk, I swiped my card and waited triumphantly for my books (and two sodas.) 

""Your card declined?"" He informed me in disbelief, and I laughed it off. I was tired, but of course! I had entered the pin wrong!

A second swipe and pin entry confirmed that no, I had indeed not entered the pin wrong. Something was amiss. 

A check of my bank account revealed that, to my shock and amazement, my paycheck had vanished! There was no sign that it was ever even deposited! My lunch that I paid for was a pending charge, but my paycheck had vanished!

In a panic, I called my bank... only to be told that they'd suffered a major power outage today, and most of their systems were offlined. Those systems that were offline were not current, and most people's debit cards weren't even working. The poor, beleaguered representative on the phone informed me that literally his phone was all he had before him that was working.

He got a job, I don't know what that means

He was still just, Daddy to me.

I want to be somebody

I want to be somebody, just like you

My point being, there are clearly connections between these cables, and in fact they give context to each other.

It makes a lot more sense in the context that there's a potential nuclear reactor going up in Burma.

For a while I've been debating a career in the military as an officer. I know all the pros and cons, I know the dangers firsthand, I know exactly what I would be getting myself into. This is not my problem. My indecision stems instead from knowing the military is likely my best course in life, but not particularly liking the idea of spending twenty years of my life living it.

However, today I learned something new about my dad. He has had a boil on his back for the past five years. It is about the size of a golf ball, and relatively painless. Recently it began to seriously hurt him, and because he doesn't have health insurance (at sixty) or a job (he was laid off recently when the construction industry went belly-up), mom had to score the boil with a knife and use a shop vac to suck all the pus out.

The resulting abscess is at least one knuckle deep.

So, I don't think I'm going to debate things too much longer. Dad followed his heart, and look where it got him.

I was able to update through Kies, everything was going swimmingly. I was loving all the new Froyo stuff (Gmail, pinch to zoom homescreens, lions and tigers and bears, oh my!). But I'm also studying for finals. So after about an hour of playing around with it, I set my phone aside. Of course, 15 minutes later I pick it up again. It comes out of standby long enough for me to see a little red notification, and, after sweeping the lockscreen, the phone shuts off.

I boot it, it goes through all the normal boot stuff, but boots to a blank screen. I do this about 4 times, then, yank the battery for 5 minutes. Boot again, nothing.

I try the 3-button panic mode, and, since I just backed everything up, I wasn't too worried about losing everything. I factory reset and clear the cache partition. Boot again, nothing. Damn. I read up on my problem, and I can say with about 95% certainty that this is due to the internal SD dying (basically just the flash memory).

I've never flashed custom roms or anything, but doing that on this phone seems to have caused a lot of grief for other people (thus, I could diagnose my own phone's problems).

103014,"I'm BPII.. so hypomania- no full blown mania. All of my hypomania was euphoric hypomania..  until 2008 (yeah, I know it was a long time ago but this all happened during a really bad period which gave me CPTSD and I've been trying so hard to get past what happened that I've only just begun looking at things like this). Basically since at least high school I've heard voices- which I thought were ghosts until my diagnosis. I could never *ever* understand what they said.. it was like they were speaking a foreign language that I used to know.. or like when you wake up from a dream and know what it was but then instantly forget. During 2008 during a time of extreme stress, depression, multiple suicide attempts, etc the voices started becoming understandable- cursing, crying, etc but that's about it. 

So one night was particularly bad- Over the course of a couple of hours this energy began to build in me which turned into extreme anger and desperation.. i felt completely detached from myself- like I was outside of myself looking down at some crazy person. Of course thoughts and images went through my head at an amazing speed- even worse than hypomanic racing thoughts.. it sort of felt like the entire world was spinning or twisting or.. something.. it just wasn't right even though I could see that it was. I felt the need to run.. as fast and as far as possible and into traffic.. then, for the first time, the voices in my head very clearly instructed me to go kill myself.. at the same time it felt like a thousand voices screaming inside my head at once. I've never felt so insane in my life. I took some sleeping pills instead of running into traffic and finally fell asleep. The next few days were pretty bad, but not as bad as that first night (but still worse than normal hypomanic energy).

Ever since then I've lost the euphoric hypomania completely. it's now replaced with anxiety, desperation, paranoia, and anger. I realize that the CPTSD may be interfering and some of the symptoms could be mixed up and I have no idea how they'd effect each other.. but I do know that having a full blown manic episode can move you from BPII to BPI. What do you guys think? A particularly bad hypomanic episode or a manic episode? 

edit: I looked it up and it seems that psychosis only accompanies mania and not hypomania.. so while it may  have been a mixed episode it was definitely not hypomania that i experienced",-1,-1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,-1,-1,-1,0,-1,-1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,-1,-1,-1,0,-1,-1,0

She is a wonderful person with a good heart, and she is smart as a whip too. I don't get to see her that often anymore because she had to switch colleges and now lives about two hours away from me. We keep in touch on occasion, but nothing like what it used to be like.

When I saw her I learned that she is having a very rough time in her life. She doesn't have very much money, her sister was just admitted for bipolar and depression last week (and my friend is not allowed to see her), she recently overdosed on her lithium medication (NOT a suicide attempt, but she has lost a large amount of weight recently and her doctors didn't seem to notice and get her a different dosage), and her current boyfriend is being a dick to her. The point is that she has it rough at the moment. 

I want to help her. I want to be there for her. I want to step my friendship game up and try to really help her out, because her family won't. They suck shit at helping her. Her sister is a little incapable at the moment, and her parents...let's just say that they didn't even visit her when she was admitted to the psychiatric hospital for over two weeks. She really is a good person, and she doesn't deserve the shit family that she has.

I told her that I want to help her, and she said something that really shocked me. She told me that I should turn and run away from her as fast as I can. She said that she was ""poison"" to anyone around her, and that I would be better off not getting involved. 

I feel like if I don't try to step in, then no one will ever stand up for her and she is going to end up worse off than she already is, but the thing is, I have no idea on how to approach this. I don't want to push her too hard, but I don't know what else to do. So, can you help me, Reddit?

I truly love my girlfriend, but since we had a baby 10 months ago the sex has been a shadow of what it once was. When we met, like most we couldn't get enough of each other.  We had great sex with mutual orgasms regularly. Fast forward three years. We dont have sex as often, but what is worse I cannot make her cum. I can help while she makes herself cum, but nothing more. I have tried to talk about it and have asked her what I can do to make it better, but she will not offer anything. I realize she may not know which is one of the reasons I am here. We are able to talk about major fantasies but not about the basics of foreplay or what is missing daily (ok weekly). I dont want the same sex we once had I just want to move on from the sex we are having. Tonight it got worse. She was too tired. So tired that she went to bed and I stayed up since it was 9:30. I got up to go to the bathroom and went to give her a kiss and she was masterbating. Within five minutes of being too tired for sex she was masterbating. I kissed her and left extremely hurt. If she had said she needed some ""alone"" time that would have been fine (not great, fine). Instead I just feel even more inadequate. I can no longer make her cum and she would rather masterbate alone than fuck me or even let me know how she feels. 

Am I wrong to be hurt. 

Regardless of my feelings, I need sexual suggestions to get this on track. I have told her I will do anything and I would. Thanks.    



edits:

Thank you all for your input. This is my first real post and I am amazed with the support. It took me a while to be able to come back and read this so I probably missed the boat.I apologize for my lack of redetiquette (your welcome). A couple of comments:
1. Sorry for the lack of spelling and general knowledge of the English language. 
2. I am not sorry for the dramatic title. Extreme? Hell yes.
3. I do not plan to leave her. We are engaged and I plan to make it work.
4. Admittedly she handles more than I do around the house. That is not to say that it is all her. Our lives have changed. I admit that she often leads the charge and I follow (does that make sense?). This is not new to the baby. I could be way off and she is carrying most of the load but I don't think that is the case.

104128,"I am a 20 year old white male, just got out of a 4 year relationship 2 weeks ago (she ended it). All I want right now is to meet someone I can have casual sex with to educate myself, since I am quite inexperienced and to have fun with. 

Before she did end it there was this girl (Ms. Kinky lets call her) who was flirting with me whenever we were both at the same party. I was foolish enough to think that Ms. Kinky was someone I could get some sexual pleasure from once/if the relationship I was in had ended (which in the end it did) because there wasn't much intimate relation between my ex and I. 

Ms. Kinky who I was flirting with, and her with me, at parties was a good friend of very my close friend's sister and she seemed to be into some pretty kinky stuff. We talked about how she only got off when she was degraded and how she really wanted someone to urinate on her at some point. Although these are not usually things that get me off I thought, maybe if I give them a try I could see if they would, and if not, at lease I had given them a try and knew that I liked them, or did not like them.

Tonight though my friend's sister as well as some other buddies and I went out drinking (without Ms. Kinky) and we had a talk. Supposedly Ms. Kinky likes to talk about all the sex she has and wishes she has but isn't quite as loose as she makes herself to be (there is some hot Russian guy in the equation). This kind of crushed my hopes of being able to explore sex more. I am quire shy when it comes to meeting new people (especially if they aren't overly social) and now I don't really know what to do.

It has been a strange couple of weeks, I've been discovering a side of me I never knew about when masturbating. Tonight I watched a porn scene with a black girl (pretty classy French lady) which I never do, the most exotic I watched previously was Latino. Further, I fingered myself for the first time while masturebating and it felt pretty good, at least when it was not too deep. 

I don't really know what is going on in my love life, I still love my ex, and I know I will for a while but don't crave to have sexual relations with her anumore. At the same time I feel I need some sexual release, with another person, not just on my own, to feel comfortable that my long term relationship has ended.

In the end I don't really know why I am posting here, I feel I need help, but am not sure why or what I need help with, maybe reddit will know.

104445,"I have a bad habit of seeing everything short of an f-close as a failure, so I can't say I'm too motivated to write this up, but it's probably a good exercise, so I will...

Started off the evening at friend of mine's place for a little pre-party before the club. I won't spend too much time on this because it kinda sucked. Everyone was really young and not so into speaking English, so I did the most boring thing possible and spent the time catching up on emails and reddit on my phone. My friend was a little annoyed, but she was also being annoying because she was stressing out pointlessly over this girl who wasn't even there. I should have handled it better, but I just wanted to get to the fucking club. Eventually, people finally started getting ready to go. They were going to walk somewhere to pick up this girl (HB10) at her house, but since the club was just around the corner and it was raining, I said I would just go to the club and see them there. 

So, I get to the club and see another friend of mine there who I don't really like, but we go to the same places and are always friendly. She's there with this cute gay boy and I chat and have a few drinks with them. It was pretty fun, but nothing special. They go off dancing, and I start checking out the room. Almost immediately, I run into this really sweet gay guy who is a friend of mine and we get to talking. Then after some minutes the HB10 that the group from the party went to pick up, finds me and comes over to say hi. She might not be a 10 to everyone, but she definitely is to me. She reminds me a lot of a young Jessica Alba. But, she is still a teenager and so it's hands off for me. But, she's hugging me and giving me lots of attention and social proof, so it's all good. I take a little break to introduce the two cute gay boys to each other, which was fun because they hit it off almost immediately and were making out in minutes. Lucky boys. :)

Then the HB10 finds me again and drags me back to dance with the group from the party. I bring her a beer because she's underage and can't go to the bar herself. She's super grateful and sweet about it. I don't normally buy girls drinks, but I'm not pursuing her. So, we hang out and get silly on the dance floor. The HB10 is in fine form tonight and starts making out with this hot blonde chick, and everyone is having a good time. Nothing too eventful happens, just some dancing and goofing off and talking to some random people about random shit.

Finally, I find myself a target... this HB9 with reddish hair. I'd seen her around before and wanted to talk with her. She's smiling at me on the dance floor, so feel like I have an opening. For some reason, I don't remember the details of how it went down, but I got the HB9 to go sit and talk with me. I know my opener wasn't anything fancy at all though. I probably just said ""Hi, I'm XX"". She's asking me questions and makes it pretty easy. When the subject of work comes up, I quickly transition it to ""what are you passionate about"" instead of ""what do you do for a living"". Since mine is writing, she asks me to tell her about one of my screenplays. Normally, I don't like this because my stories are kind of weird and hard to explain. But, I actually manage to pull it off very well and she's pretty impressed. Well, now my sweet little HB10 pops up again, and so does a gay guy friend of the HB9. They are a bit distracting and we kinda want to keep talking, but the guy friend kind of drags her off and she looks regretful. So, the HB10 and I talk, and when I tell her I like the HB9, she's like ""let's go get her!"". I guess she had noticed the HB9 and her gay friend head into the women's bathrooms, so we go in there to. Well, there's a little couch in there and everyone seems to be hanging there... my HB9 and some people the HB10 and I know. So, I sit next to the HB9 and we get chatting again, don't remember about what though. The HB10 leans over and starts telling the HB9 how awesome I am. It was so obvious, but really cute too. I wanted to get some kino going but was really overthinking it. I don't usually have that problem, so I think maybe it was more that the vibe just wasn't there.

Eventually, we get out of the bathroom. The club is closing soon, so I want to get the HB9 to bounce somewhere else with me since it's too soon to ask her back to my place. But, this is where something bad happens.... the HB9 asks how old I am. I'm 41 and she tells me she's 22. Ouch. I try to keep it over 25. I can tell she's not so cool with how old I am. She starts on about how she has to get up early, blah blah. So, I take the opportunity to get her to put her number in my phone. The HB10 shows up again and tells my HB9 something, I don't know what, but I'm almost certain it's more nice stuff about me. It's a bit childish, but hey, I am hanging out with kids. The HB9 was smiling though, so it was all good. Well, now the club really is closing and we are figuring out what to do next. I want to go party somewhere else, but everyone else just wants to go eat so we do that. There was no opening at all for me to try and k-close the HB9 otherwise I would have went for it to find out how put off she really was about my age. So, I just say goodbye to the HB9 and we head out.

Nothing much happens from there, except a little awkwardness because the HB9 and her friends showed up at the same place we went to get food. Small town. I didn't even notice her until the HB10 pointed her out. I just wave and say hi, but don't pursue any interaction with her. There wasn't any chance she was just going to leave and go home with me, so I didn't see any point. So, we just eat and have some laughs and then I hop in a taxi home... alone. :(

I don't know if I should text the HB9 or not. I really can't decide. I think she's a little too young and she probably thinks I'm a little too old, but I will very likely run into her again, so feel like maybe I should send her a ""was nice meeting you"" text today at least. It always feels a little awkward to me when I see a girl again after getting her number and not using it. I don't know. I probably won't bother, but what do you guys think?

EDIT: Well, the lesbian social network being what it is, word got back to me that the HB9 isn't interested, so I'm not texting her.

Thinking about those notes last night, I was getting obsessed with the question if this kinda behavior could ever get anything going as it now seems so ultra-beta to me.

If I Were God

If I were God, I would create other Gods. Why create useless spirit beings who need to go through mortal probation before becoming gods and just skip straight to the end? And it just makes sense: humans make humans, cats make cats, dogs make dogs, and gods should create gods, not spirit beings. Any God claiming to be omnipotent and were not to do this is clearly not imnipotent, or is sadistic.

Assuming that is impossble (what is impossible to an omnipotent being?) then I would create human beings, but not perfect human beings. Why? Perfect beings are boring. It is our imperfections that make us interesting. However, I would not punish my creations for their imperfection, which I designed at least not the imperfect traits that harm no one. Murder is bad, but sexual relation outside of marriage is alright with me. I fail to see how it's a sin until a person obtain a paper stating that they are wed. However, cheating on your significant other would be a sin. 

if I were God, I would forgo a savior in exchange that we each suffer for our own sins, either while we're dying or shortly after, a Purification Process, as i would call it.. Now, before you imagine the suffering and agony that Jesus went through, keep in mind he suffered for everyone. That's 40 billion people he's suffering for. Divide his pain by 40 billion and i imagine even the weakest among us can overcome such pain. Not only would this make us more responsible for our actions, it would also ensure that everyone would get into Heaven and make Hell obsolete. 

While on the subject, if I were God, I would not send my spirit child, in my infinite love for him, to Hell. A spirit being who seeks to overthrow an omnipotent being doesn't deserve jail, they need to be put into a mental rehabilitation center for retardation. Why would I condemn someone such as this to eternal suffering simply because I need someone to test my human subjects? Truly only a sadistic God would do such an act. 

If I were God, I would not create microbial diseases. This seems unnecessary. And, I would eliminate hunger and thirst by simply making basic foods and fresh water more abudant (makes sense). No more starving, aids-infected children in Africa. Seems only fair that everyone start off on a promising foot, if not an equal one.

Lately things gave been getting worse, causing my mother to begin to think about divorce (she's gone to the lawyer already for preliminarily talks). Today I was woken up by my father yelling about something. I then heard a loud 'bang' and my mother yell for my sister. I rushed downstairs to see my mother on the floor. My father obviously claims she did it to herself (despite that not making sense at all). My mom claims her pushed her and tried to choke her. In the ensuing arguments, we were all threatened both physically and financially. To make matters worse my mother has a dangerous operation in a week.

My family needs your advice Reddit. What options do we have? What should we do? We are scared for our safety (we left the house), but have limited financial means to leave (mom is an under-paid secretary at a school and I'm a poor IT major. I'm sorry I'm so vague right now, but I'm just looking for any and all options you all can provide. Thank you in advance.

106087,"During all the funeral and services I didn't cry at all. I only cried a little, I bottled it all up. Over the past few weeks I haven't been sleeping full nights, but I don't feel tired during the day. Food doesn't taste as good as it use to. Even watching Always Sunny doesn't bring me the laughs it use to.

Over Thanksgiving when I was home, there was a memorial service and a dedication to him that our state senator attended, I started crying there a little but I bottled it up, but something was different. 

And over the past few days its been coming out more and more. Now I'm a wreck. Him dying may as well have happened today or yesterday. This is what happens when you bottle shit up.

The problem is I'm at University right now studying for finals and I can't concentrate at all. I have good friends here but I've only known them for over a year and half. I only have 3 true best friends here that I feel like I can tell them anything. I told 2/3 and they have been more than understanding. I just feel so fucked up. My third best friend is the one I have the most in common with and the one I like the most out of all them. But he has been putting the meeting off, but I don't think he has any idea what I'm going to tell him.

I just feel so fucked up right now and I don't want my friends to see me like this. But I do want the ones I consider family to see me, because I feel it will only further bond us. It is worth noting that all of them are connected to the Marines or ROTC. I guess thats the connection I feel the deepest with them.

My family at home knows that I've been having trouble with it, but even if they came out I don't have time to really meet with them because of finals. I communicate with them all the time, but they are a 7 hour car ride away, they haven't gotten over it yet and I don't want them to upset them more. 

I talked to a physchologist but it didn't help me at all. I talked to family and best friends in high school but they are so far away and technology is just not doing it. I need physical human reaction. I need human contact, not with my family but close friends if that makes any sense. I value loyalty and friendship above all other things. I know my family will always be there when I need them. But I have some insecure need (serious metacognition going on right now) to be with someone who isn't family. The act that there choosing to stay by my side because there not my family is even more meaningful for me. 

TL;DR - After one year and half I have just gotten over the shock of my cousins death and the grief and everything is hitting me like a ton of bricks.

What about all the current regulations? Is it also possible that unemployment is the result of to many laws? If you were unemployed and decided to take up farming, how many regulations would you have to jump through to farm and sell the food? What about a building contractor, private counselling, giving legal advise, or setting up a bank to loan money?

What is stopping people from forming socialist type organizations within a capitalistic system. If the top 1% of the population is making 25% of the wealth, and the top 20% is making 50% of the wealth, should it not be possible to form organizations that are community run and provide jobs with 50% more pay?

Personally, I like the idea of communism and socialism, but only by choice and not by force.

I'm a college student who loves to cook, and my current nice cookbooks are Julia Child's and Rick Bayless's... not exactly 30-minute dishes, and not exactly full of ingredients I'll ever use again. Cook's Illustrated has always had incredible recipes, and this book is just full of well-written instructions and beautiful pictures. I think I'll be making spaghetti with garlic, olive oil, and artichokes when artichokes are back in season... for now ""quick pan sauces"" is probably going to be very helpful as I love throwing chicken in a pan for a quick fry with butter, and homemade ravioli.

109518,"Question:  My long-term girlfriend recently admitted to sending sexually explicit text messages to a former boyfriend.  I don't know whether to dump her, take it in stride, or what?

 Here's the deal:  

- I've been dating a girl on and off for about ten years. We started dating just as I was graduating high school and she was finishing her sophomore year.

- The relationship has been tough in a lot of ways.  Much of it has been long distance, given our different locations for college, periods where both of us were traveling abroad, and now, my attending law school.

- There have been a few major break ups.  After I finished college, I moved to the city she was studying in, but she broke up with me almost immediately upon my arrival.  I was heartbroken at the time.  She dated a few other guys.  I had a serious relationship with another girl for a bit, but pretty clearly never got over her.  It took me about three years, but I ultimately got her back.

- After I started law school, and the relationship had become long distance again (Boston to New York, so we see each other three or four times a month and summers), she proposed that we try an open relationship.  I flipped and broke up with her, not so much because I wasn't open to the idea, but because I felt pressured by her to accept her proposal, and I suspected there was a particular person she wanted to date.  I turned out to be right, but things did no go well with him.  She ultimately asked to get back together with me, and I accepted.

- About a year and a half ago, she confessed to having kissed a boy at a party.  She explained that she was totally drunk and apologized.  I let it go as a one time thing.  Despite the prior break ups, this was the first time, as far as I'm aware, that she'd ever done anything with another person while we were dating.

- Since then, things seemed to really stabilize.  We had a ton of fun over the summer.  She even began talking about getting married, and seemed to be very happy in the relationship.  If anything, tables seemed to have flipped, and I seemed to be the person more relaxed about the relationship, though by all means I was still happy to be with her.

- About a week ago, she confessed to getting drunk and sending sexually explicit text messages to both the guy she dated the last time we were broken up and the guy she kissed a year before at the party.

- This shocked me.  Whenever something had happened before, there had been plenty of warning signs.  She'd seemed totally fine with things.  At first I acted like I didn't care, but then I flipped out.  She apologized, but also said she felt like this was just something she had a problem with.  She downplayed it, saying it was only flirting, but also saying that she just wasn't sure she could guarantee that this kind of thing would never happen again.  I told I was seriously considering breaking up with her.  This seemed to really surprise and distress her, and she asked me not to, but I refused to commit either way.  

- A day later, I called her up late, waking her up.  After a few minutes chatting about random stuff, she started breaking down crying.  She said that the world seemed colorless over the time since she'd confessed.  She was under stress from a bunch of different places as well, but she claimed she was feeling suicidal.  She asked me again not to break up with her.  She said she still wanted to marry me.  She just doubted her ability to control her herself 100% of the time, and thought it shouldn't be a big deal if we do a little ""flirting.""  She offered to go to a relationship counselor with me.  I told her I wouldn't break up with her.  The idea of her killing herself hardly seemed worth a few naughty text messages, regardless of how explicit they were.  Furthermore, if possible, I would like to stay with her.

I don't know how to to handle this.  On the one hand, I'm totally in love with this girl, and as far as I'm aware, the worst of her behavior wasn't really that big of deal.  On the other hand, I fear that her behavior is indicative of a deeper imbalance in the relationship.  It bothers the hell out of me that she can't give me any meaningful assurance she won't ""flirt"" with other people again in the future.  And it super bothers me that the texts were not to people at the party, but to people she'd had some level of intimacy with before.  It would have been one thing if she'd just gotten caught up in the moment.

Thoughts?

EDIT: Formatting.  Also, thanks for responses so far.

EDIT: Just want to point out, breaking up with her would be extremely hard.  I've been with her a long time, and am deeply in love with her.  She may be manipulating me, but at the same time, I'm positive my leaving her would be absolutely devastating to her.  (I don't think those two things are entirely mutually exclusive.)  

Also, I listed the points of difficulty in the relationship above, but try put them in the context of knowing someone for ten years and dating them for most of that time, nearly all of which was filled with lots of good times and intimacy.  I may be deluding myself, but at this point, I still absolutely do believe that she loves me and that she's been honest with me.  For all of the above events, she could have easily hidden them from me, but chose not to.  While that doesn't justify anything she's done whatsoever, I value her honesty and give her some degree of credibility as a result.  While she says she can't guarantee she won't engage in ""flirtatious"" behavior, she points out that she has never done anything so serious as sleeping with someone else, or even close, and has no problem saying she wouldn't do that.

Please don't take this to mean I'm disregarding anyone's advice.  I'm not, even though it's hard advice for me to take.

EDIT:  The text messages were all text, not photos.

EDIT:  Look, when she said she couldn't guarantee it would never happen again, I think people are imagining she was being defiant.  It wasn't like that.  It sounded like it was coming from a place of remorse, like looking back over her own behavior, she was genuinely disappointed in herself, and now doubted her own self control.  I realize I'm being ridiculously forgiving in my assessment of what she was saying, but if I were to tell her she had to get her head straight and figure out if she really wanted to be with me, and if so, guarantee it wouldn't happen again, would that be reasonable?  

Or the only reasonable response is to flat out dump this girl that I've been dating for a decade?  I realize I'm the one asking for the advice, but I've got to suspect that anyone who cavalierly says dump someone you've been with for a decade has never done it.  It would be hard as hell.  This would be a lot like going through a divorce.  It's that serious of a relationship.  We're close with one another's family, etc.  It would be ugly and hard.

UPDATE:  Had a long conversation with her in which I made it clear to her that her getting herself to a place where she could tell me confidently and genuinely that this wouldn't happen again was an absolute condition of us moving forward.  As was deleting all her contact information for both of the people she texted.  She continued to claim she loved me, but was disturbingly non-committal.  She asked how long she could have to think about it.  I said a month tops.  She also agreed to set up a counseling appointment.  I realize that for most people that have commented, this would still constitute ""doormat"" behavior, but whatever.  Apparently, that's the ""toughest"" I know how to be.  Given the tone of her response, I strongly suspect we will be broken up soon enough regardless.

I decided to give you the best gift anyone has ever received: the eternal love of our lord. lol, no, just kidding, your shit is on it's way. you'll love it. btw, I stole this bible from a hotel. You can use this bible for rolling papers, enjoy anyway.""

That package is on it's way to him now. In my defense, I did the *slow* shipping on that package, and I'll do the *fast* shipping on the real gift, so he won't be waiting long.

I don't know, did I go too far?

EDIT: I should add that I've been sending him PMs from another throwaway. I think he'll like it. Also, I work in a hotel, and the Gideons gave us *fucking boxes* of bibles.

I noticed that while using the internet, the font isn't as clear as I'm used to with Windows 7.

Here is a pic of a side-by-side comparison: http://imgur.com/kqTKF

I'm actually running Parallels (love it) when I took the screenshot, so even though the window on the right is displayed within OSX, it's actually running via Windows 7. 

I've tried all of the resolution settings in OSX, and 1440x900 is the only one that looks right, but it still looks fuzzy. Any ideas?

**update:** Thank you for the responses below - I hadn't know about font smoothing, or how Windows and Apple render fonts differently. I didn't mean to imply that ""fuzzier"" rendering is worse - I just immediately associated the sharper font as more accurate, which I now realize isn't true. 

I played with turning font smoothing off, but I didn't notice a different. Regardless, I expect to just get used to the font smoothing. I would rather be seeing fonts as they are intended to be seen. I imagine that if the general, uninformed public were given a test, they would prefer the sharper-looking font in a side-by-side comparison, so don't fault me for asking :).",-1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-1,-1,-1,0,-1,-1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-1,-1,-1,0,-1,-1,0

I have a weird, weird, weird relationship with food.  Anyone who has had an ED will sympathize.  I have hard time not hoarding food, and it is hard for me to tell what is too little and what is too much food.  

The hardest part is losing weight.  I can't really weigh myself or count calories, because I know I will become obsessed.  When I'm not doing my disordered eating (which I haven't been for the last three years).   I gain weight, because I'm not purging or over exercising or starving myself.  But I when I start to try to lose weight, I can't do it in a healthy way.  So I start obsessing and throwing up and then BAM!  I'm back where I started.  So I stop trying to lose weight and then I gain again. 

I want to know how to eat like a regular person and how to have a healthy relationship with food.

""The bible says that husbands are like God, and wives are like the Church. Wives should respect, honor, and admire their husbands like the church respects, honors, and admires God. Husbands should cherish and protect their wives the way God cherishes and protects the church"". 

As a woman, you show appreciation and in return you get devotion. I was raised this way and I believed it for a long time. It can seem like a fair trade if you're taught from the start that what you want is protection and devotion. I was taught from an early age that I do not want respect, honor, and appreciation. That's what men want. 

When I got to dating age, I started reading ""secular"" literature on the subject of relationships. I completely bought what John Grey says about men wanting appreciation and women wanting attention, understanding, affection, etc. For a few years I maintained relationships by providing boatloads of appreciation and admiration and sometimes getting affection in return. I was also an emotional wreck and I never felt that I was doing it right. I didn't know if I was providing an adequate amount of admiration and every time a problem arose, I could only assume it was a result of my not doing it right. After all, everything I knew about relationships said that men respond in a uniform way to your ability to understand them and meet their needs. They will meet your needs IF you adequately meet theirs. Under my formula, the entire relationship rested on my ability to give my boyfriend exactly the right feelings at exactly the right times. It was too much pressure and those relationships ended with me feeling incredibly bitter and slighted. 

Now, I've matured a lot. I'm married. I have a very happy marriage and my husband is awesome. But I can tell you that we didn't get here by following a formula that says how I should treat him and how he should treat me. In fact, that formula almost collapsed our relationship in the beginning as it had done to so many of my other relationships. It was my abandonment of that formula that made me capable of a real relationship with another human. 

So, for those young women who are reading the Men Are From Mars nonsense, hear this. There are very few people on this planet who don't want appreciation and admiration. Women and men alike desire admiration. For one gender to declare ""We are intended by our biological nature to be the recipients of appreciation, and You the recipients of devotion"" is utterly ridiculous. It is and has always been an extension of religious teachings, which do and have always existed to make men feel extra good about themselves. The system does not benefit you. Do not be fooled into thinking it might. The best it can do is convince you to live a lie, working hard for things that you do not actually want, and wanting things that the system is not going to provide you.",-1,-1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-1,-1,-1,0,-1,-1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-1,-1,-1,0,-1,-1,0
112957,"I don't know if I'm allowed to post non-cries-for-help here but I thought this might be really helpful to some people who come here.

I've struggled with depression/anxiety for years, and as a result gone through various periods of thinking of suicide. I've also had different doctors/therapists/psychiatrists/etc classify these thoughts differently, so I thought that having a little guide might be helpful to some people here.


**Suicidal Ideation** - This is when something goes wrong and you just kind of think, ""Well, I could always kill myself,"" but you don't really intend to go through with it. You feel like you could be driven to that point if things don't pick up, and you're scared that you're even thinking about it at all, but you're not likely to do anything rash today.


**Obsessive/Intrusive Suicidal Thoughts** - Intrusive thoughts are those really uncomfortable thoughts you get sometimes. Like, if you're holding a kitten, you suddenly realize that you have the power to kill that cat with your bare hands. And then you're disgusted with yourself for even thinking that, and you just feel ashamed. Sometimes these are suicidal thoughts though, and you get really scared because you don't really want to kill yourself, but you keep thinking about it all the time. Everything that happens, you just keep reminding yourself how easy it would be to end it, even though you don't really want to.


**Suicidal Intentions - This is when you have a knife/pills/gun beside you, and you're just waiting for the right moment. I don't need to explain this. If you are here, call 911/999 or whatever your emergency number is.**


**Panic Attacks** - Any of these can cause you to be really upset, especially if you're not intending to kill yourself but can't stop thinking about it. As hard as it is at the time, the best way to stop this is to distract yourself. **Go make a sandwich.** You don't have to eat the sandwich, you don't have to be hungry, just go make a sandwich. Do it well. Tie the bread back, straighten the cheese, etc. Make a cup of coffee, go for a walk, anything to distract yourself.


Regardless of which of these you're experiencing, you need to talk to someone. And even if Reddit or your chosen hotline or friend manage to calm you down, it might be a good idea to talk to your doctor. Mention your felt this way, and if applicable mention that you feel better but that you're concerned.


Again, if anyone feels like this is in the wrong place or whatever... I dunno, the mods can delete it.

I'm in the mood to rant - I'm starting a job in a new city (DC) in a few days (am moving away from pretty much all of my friends and family and all that jazz) and every single person I've talked to has asked me, who's the boy? 

My father assumes I'm moving because of an old college beau. He often tells me this with an error of superiority, like yeah sure you're moving for a ""Job."" And last night while talking to this previous man-friend (the beau), he brought it to my attention that he still thinks I'm after his pants. I'd also like to point out I told the cocky son of a bitch I was through with him over a year ago. 

So now, I reach my breaking point. This is my second time getting up and moving away from all family and friends. I am graduating from one of the most difficult universities in the United States, am starting an awesome job in a city with a thriving job market, and even though people know me as brilliant, motivated, and the type of person that'd do anything for a career they STILL ask if I am moving to DC because of the past beau or if it's for some other boy they haven't met. 

So someone tell me, are even modern day women still expected to live their lives for a boy? Can a girl not do something for herself? 

And what is the best way to inform my dad and co that I am not co-dependent?

113317,"Hey reddit. Over the last three weeks, i have wet my bed a sum total of 3 times. This has happened to me a couple times before in the past, but never with this level of proximity and those incidents occurred after traumatic or distressing events. But that's not the case here. I've been on break for the last three weeks, i'm currently the happiest i've been in three years, except for this morning because it just happened again and i accidentally broke my phone in the panicked fray with my bed sheets.

A lot's happened over the last three weeks. First off, i quit smoking. I've only been a smoker for roughly two years. No patches, just cold turkey and to be honest i'm doing fine. Yeah, i get cravings but it hasn't been incredibly difficult except for right now as i'm typing this, and there are none in reach. I do smoke trees though.

Also, my sleeping patterns have changed suddenly. I'm 21 years old and a student. I'm used to being up all hours of the night working and getting 2-4 hours of sleep on average if i'm lucky enough to sleep at all. Suddenly, i get about 6-8 hours a night and my sleeping patterns have become regular seemingly overnight. Problem is, i zonk out around midnight without realizing it and might have had a lot of fluids in my system, but it's never been a problem before. I've come back from partying and clubbing unaware of a full bladder and it has never caused me problems.


Finally, there's this girl.... i'll skip the sappy stuff, but around three weeks ago i met this girl and she's great. She's the reason i've quit smoking and probably the reason i'm not stressing out about it. However, i'm wondering if the surge in hormones might be related. This is the first girl i haven't completely disregarded since my last relationship, and i haven't had these feelings in a long time.

Also, it's been happening early in the morning... between 5-7 a.m. during a dream. I vaguely remember pissing in my dream last night, but i can't be sure about the other times.

This is really making me worried, and i don't want to see a doctor yet. If the same thing happens again over the course of the week i will, but i'm not ready just yet so i thought i'd come to you guys first. Right now my thoughts are sounding like a bad episode of House. I don't know if things i mentioned are related or if all of this is merely coincidental. It's just that it's all happening at once. Please... if there's any advice you guys can give, i would appreciate it so much

Edit: TLDR; i'm wetting my bed

3x over 3 weeks

Possible related factors:
1) quit smoking
2) drastic shift in sleep pattern
3) love and raging hormones
4) weird ass dreams

Edit2: Spacing 

Edit3: Just so we're clear, i don't have bladder control issues when i'm conscious.  For the most part, i feel fine and i don't seem to be experiencing any other problems related to peeing or otherwise.  It's just that three times in three weeks is fucking weird.  

Edit4: Talked to my pops.  He's a little worried since he's a physical therapist (and my dad).  Both my parents are in the medical field.  I'm seeing the doctor tomorrow.  He thinks it's probably emotional or anxiety issues, but like i said i've been the happiest i've been in years.

113593,"English is not my first language, so sorry about any grammar upfront. 

Here's the deal. I'm in my late twenties, single (for some time) and live in a pretty big city. Over a period of time I have managed to establish casual sexual relationship with 6 different women. I will like to point at this moment that they are all totally aware that the sex is no strings attached, and I am not lying or deceiving anyone. I do not ask them if they have other partners, and they do not ask me. We are all fairly good at protecting ourselves, so that moral part is also taken care of. Of course though, the women do not know about each other, and for some reason this (sick?) thought popped into my head that I want to do them, all within 24 hours. Normally it can go weeks, and even months, between every ""encounter"". With christmas coming up though,  I think there might be a possibility with time off and lots of parties. 

So, what is the best plan for this to work? A couple of the girls will be no problem doing in-and-out operations in a few hours, others will be annoyed if I do not spend the night. Tell them I have family parties and have to leave? Make a friend call me and simulate emergency? Also, how do I stay horny and on target? I have Cialis, so that part is taken care of...

Thanks!

Edit. Will put some info about the women, I know that the 1-10 scale on people is pretty douche, but it is the easiest way forward here.

a) 24, the least attractive and most horny. This must be the first one as I could come (no pun intended :p) and leave within 15 minutes without her really caring that much...well I think of course. I'll give her a 5 on a scale from 1-10.

b) 29, I could get away with a few hours here - I'll give her a weak 6.


c) 22, here too I could get away with a few hours, but need better explanation. Also weak 6. 


d) 27, this i where it get's though. From here on I think it's gonna get hard to get away without causing trouble/loosing the possibility to ever get back. I have not known her for very long, and she's hotter, probably a weak 7. 


e) 25, this one I have known for a long time, but will also get PO if I do not spend the night. Strong 6.


f) 29, most challenging. Got a kid and is really hot, solid 8. I do not think I can even get action going here if I do not intend to fall asleep next to her, not that she's into me emotionally I think, it's just that she does not want to feel slutty.

114605,"It's hard not to be touched when you browse the gallery-- handmade gifts, paintings, gifts that were purchased after an elaborate amount of research of the giftee. While no one really participates in SS for the sake of what they can get out of it, it's certainly true that some put in more effort than others. And there's imbalance out there, some people might feel guilty to get something really crazy after being able to only afford a few minutes time to give back. 

Ultimately, there's two types of Santa's, those who enjoy dipping their feet in the water, respect the $15 suggestion, and see this as a fun little side romp-- and those who are in it for the glory: I'm talking the ones who want to go crazy and cyberstalk their giftee for weeks, who would commission a small statue or name a star after someone, those who refuse to rest until their giftee's year has been positively made.

So why not add a ""Secret Santa Plus"" of sorts. A place where the hardcore SS'ers can go, who can not only contribute like a star but might even get to enjoy the same kind of dedication back. While we all enjoy giving for the pure joy of giving, it's gotta be nice to know what the feeling is reciprocated. **Note: This is not about the money. The $15 range is still fine, no one is expecting iPads, it's about the effort.** 

This isn't about creating classes, but simply put, if you want to go the extra mile you can do so with people who you know are going to pay it forward with as much gusto as you have! If you're spending hours, it's gotta be great to know the person you're giving to is doing the same to someone else, right? Who knows, this might even challenge those who were happy on the sidelines to jump in and get their skin in the game.

The only issue would be: how would this be set up? It would have to be limited at first: perhaps only those who have contributed in previous years' Secret Santa events? This way you would filter out the scrooges (at least to an extent) who are just in it for taking and not giving.

114979,"Hi Reddit,

I have been programming web applications for about 1.5 years (PHP mostly).

I haven't been learning it in the 'correct' way of using either books or some sort of an online course. I used code examples and grew from there on by creating small applications and moved forward to making larger web applications.

I always learned stuff as I built my applications, so for examples, I never learned how to use sockets because I never needed to use sockets in any of my applications.


I want to try and learn new stuff without 'needing' them within my current application.

There are probably a lot of stuff that I didn't even know that exists therefore couldn't know if I needed them or not.

What would you suggest for a beginning web developer to master at?

115235,"Hi,

Today I just need someone there. I don't feel very well.

Just gonna sum up most of the story: Was with this girl for three years, from age 23-26. Lived together for over a year. She moved out. She feel in love with someone new and we broke up - but they were together, before or after. Then after some time we started seeing each other again. Then I found out she had been cheating on me one time when we lived together. Wasn't together. Were together. Wasn't together. Were together. I sort of broke up. We started seeing each other again for a bit. Now I know that she found someone new - but she doesn't know that I know.

I guess this is the story about someone you should have left alone for over a year ago, instead of spending a long time being and not being with her. It's gotten inside my head now, and I can't get it out.

Feel sort of hungry, thirsty and tired. Cries a lot. Can't get my head straight and start doing the things I should be doing.

What is the problem I'm having and the reason I'm posting?

I don't know. I don't know what it really is. Maybe the fact that when we ended up being together again and I found out she had been cheating I never felt that she really said that she was sorry. I kept wanting to hear her say it and really mean it. And she did say it, but for some reason not the way I wanted to hear it. You know what I mean?

And now, I want for her to be unhappy. I don't want her to go on being happy and in love with this guy she just found. I want her to feel fucking miserable and have a lousy Christmas with her stinking family. Just typing this feels nice. It feels like hatred, which is a much more ""active"" feeling than setting here and pity myself.

She just found this new guy and in a day or two she is going to call me and tell me about it ""so that I don't find out from someone else"". I'm not going to pick up. I just deleted all her texts, and my texts to her. Then deleted everything we ever sent each other on facebook (a period of four years that just went bye-bye) and on email. Maybe this is also what hurts. Pushing her out and trying to say to myself that I won't allow myself to see her, or even listen to her again.

I've been fine, happy actually because I am not in the borderline emotional abusive relationship anymore. I consider myself a very happy, funny, friendly, and good spirited guy and I do not have a problem meeting new people. I know I am not in any condition to have a long-term relationship but I still want to date. The girl I was with was the only real girlfriend I have ever had and she was my first for everything.

I recently just started going out there meeting new people. There was actually this one girl who I fell head over heels for, I only met her for two days but within those two I really liked her. We talked for a long time telling our life stories and I made her laugh the whole night. I ended up flat out telling that I liked her, she responded saying the she liked me too.

We ended up studying for our finals the next day and she was still cool, we got lunch after and everything was fine. I later ask her to see if she wanted to to watch a movie or something. She then says she likes me and thinks I am a cool guy but she isn't ready for anything more than friendship. I then told her that I understand but I had to just tell her how I was feeling(that I thought she was pretty amazing and that I liked her, also if she just wanted to be friends that is ok).

I'm young enough where I haven't been corrupted yet like those old farts up in Ottawa, and I never intend to sell out. The government sold us out a long time ago, and it's been a continual downhill battle since then. 

The Conservative government has brought us to a $60 billion deficit, with no signs of slowing down. Our rights and our own constitution have been abandoned in favor of corporations and government interest, not in the interest of the people. And it's pissing me off like nothing else. I was proud to be Canadian, to live in the freest country in the world, and now I am ashamed that our politicians are ruining this country by the day and the average Canadian doesn't stand up for their fellow citizen.

I want to start a new political party, one based on complete transparency, truth, and in the best interests of the people in mind. An Independent MP can not change anything, hence why the need for a party. This is a monumental task that I'm thinking of, but if we ever want change, something has to be done soon before we become the US Lite. I have the foundations of the party written down, the goals and aims, and I am sure I speak for all Canadians in that our current politicians do not have the interests of Canadians at heart. I do, and I intend to fix the wrongs that we have been brought into. I'm not doing this for money, only the personal satisfaction that what I want to do is right. Personal glory, but not for any personal gain.

So, fellow Canadians, how do you start a new nation wide political party and get a majority win in the Federal Government? Door to door will not work, I am just one man, I have no resources (I prefer it this way at this time, actually) to speak of right now except my knowledge and this guide line. How do I recruit members to run for MP positions, how do I get Canadians to wake up and realize that we are being fed lies daily?

I do not want to be like the Green or Pirate Party, they can not be taken seriously because they do not have all of the interests of Canadians in mind, only their small circle of ideas. To become as big as the Conservative or Liberal party, that is the goal.

I have made a new account for the sole reason of keeping my personal information personal at this time. I can not afford to expose myself at this time when nothing is sure.

Yes, eating meat is less efficient than eating a plant if you are just looking at what ends up as delicious muscle. I'm not talking about factory farming and cow calf operations, I agree those are obviously dumb. I am however fucking tired of people thinking that a boycott on meat is going to save the world. 

Here's the think, animals eat food that we aren't going to eat. They turn unpalatable plant matter into delicious, calorie-packed meat. Say you live in the desert southwest, as I do now. Yes, you have you cow tanks and their evaporation, and that's basically it. If I recall, a thirsty cow can drink about 30gal/day. This is NOTHING in comparison to the amount of water needed to grow crops to produce a similar caloric yield on land that is not naturally suited for it. That doesn't even account for what goes into growing those crops, e.g., labor, tractors, fertilizers, and pesticides etc. 

PLEASE address your eating decisions on a place by place basis, and above all else, eat local. It's the best thing you can do. If you live in the Northwest and can throw seeds in the ground, do nothing else, and get a harvest, then yes, go for it.

Since then, he let me know that he hasn't been eating except when invited out by friends.  I don't know how long this has been the case.  His sleep has been erratic and his stress levels high (but yeah, finals).  He also hasn't been going to the gym to my knowledge, whereas he used to go regularly.  He started becoming kind of gloomy when we would talk, including some kind of paranoid-sounding conspiracy theory stuff about the government.  I know in the light of Wikileaks everything's fair game, but we're talking secret-Halliburton-concentration-camps stuff.  He has always had his moments, like anyone else, of questioning the meaning of life and not feeling satisfied with the world, but I'm realizing this is serious.

Yesterday he informed me that he feels our relationship is holding each of us back and that with the doubts he has, he'd rather get out now than ten years from now when we'd be married with kids.  It completely hit me from out of left field, because I had thought everything was going great, and I'd only seen the other issues as exam stress with a bit of winter blues (and perhaps wikileaks paranoia).  Now I feel like it may actually be serious depression and he's trying to push me out.  He won't answer calls or messages, but mutual friends at his campus have checked on him and attempted to talk to him, so I know he's at least physically okay, but they agree something appeared not to be right.

Reddit, am I just trying to rationalize the loss of the relationship, or is there something greater to be concerned about here?  I have been a train wreck myself but I've been talking to friends and I'm getting my butt into counseling tomorrow.  If there's some way I could or should be helping him, I'd do it because I obviously still love him.

118800,"One of my best friends of 5 years went on a mission trip to Haiti last summer. She went with a church group that had 5 adults and 4 teenagers. They were there for 2 weeks, helped build a church/school and had a wonderful, yet difficult, time there.


Since my friend came back, she has had a very close relationship/friendship with the 4 teenagers. She has friendships with the other adults that were on the trip, but nothing like the kids. What makes this awkward for most people is that she is 48 years old. 3 of the kid's parents have asked her to stop hanging out with their kids so much, it makes them uncomfortable. The minister of the church and the couple that run the youth group have also talked to her about it, saying that it makes some of the adults (ie: the parents) uncomfortable. She doesn't listen. It has been perticularly difficult with one of the girl's mothers. Her mother has even gone so far as to take her daughters phone away and even move to a different church to keep them from seeing eachother.




My friend refuses to respect the parents wishes. She texts the kids constantly, during work, late at night (sometimes til 3am or later), she takes them places, and has sleepovers with the girls. She also tries to act more like a teenager now too, which is part of what bothers *me* the most.




I've listened to her outline the issues she is having with the parents and I have tried to stay unbiased and give her what I think is good advice. I've told her that she needs to think of how the parents feel in this situation. This just upsets her because she doesn't (and cannot) have children, so she get's defensive. I've also told her that some of these parents are overreacting and *could* think of this as an opportunity for their kids to have a positive adult rolemodel in their lives. The problem is, I don't think that she actually *is* a positive adult rolemodel. It's not that she is a bad person or does anything 'wrong' per se; it is that I see her conforming to their attitudes and behaviors and trying to be just like them.. so how is that a role model at all? My friend is vice president of a motorcycle ministry, is going to school to finish her bachelor's, owns her house and is very active in the community. I do not understand how a woman so strong minded and positive can all of a sudden start acting like any other teenage girl.



My friend has completely turned one of the girls against her mother. To the point that the girl has said as soon as she turns 18 she is leaving and wants to move in with my friend. As a mother myself, I have a really hard time with this. It makes me very angry to know that she is purposely defying this girl's parents. The girl was grounded from her phone, but my friend ""just couldnt wait weeks to talk to her again"" so she would call the girls friend and talk to her on that phone instead. Some of the comments my friend makes sounds more like a parent fighting for custody than a woman just missing her friend. She says things like 'how is their right to keep her away from me'. They email eachother and talk in code so that her mom doesn't know what they are really talking about. When she tells me these things I tell her it's wrong, but she gets defensive and will end the conversation.




Because of her new friendships with these kids, we spend a lot less time together. So sometimes I think maybe I am just being over critical because someone who is one of my best friends just doesnt have a whole lot of time for me anymore. But then I can't help but think, if this was my son or daughter, I would be furious if an adult friend did not respect my wishes. It is scary to see how much she clings to these kids and how much they idolize her. I've asked her what it is that makes her feel so strongly about them, and she cannot answer that. She says, she doesn't know.. just something about the trip to Haiti bonded them and she doesn't want to be without them.




Over the past couple of months my friend has made some derogatory comments to me that have really thrown me for a loop. They leave me thinking, did she really just say that? Indivdually they are nothing, but when you put them together it shows me that she has changed.. maybe too much for me. I am not even sure that I want to be her friend anymore and it is mostly because of her relationship with these kids. I just cannot wrap my head around it. feh.

**Some background...**

I've been in a serious relationship with this girl for just over 2 years. There is an age gap, she's 21 and I just turned 27. I've got a good job, decent pay. Otherwise enjoying my life, healthy, happy and all is well. She's about to enter her final semester of college. We've had overall a pretty good 2 years. She's had some trouble adjusting to being in a serious relationship as she's never been in one before dating me. She also came from a very, very conservative home. About as conservative as you can get without being considered fundamentalist. She's definitely the most open-minded person in her family, but a lot of their ideas about religion, relationships and other things are still tightly wrapped around her frontal lobe like an anaconda. She doesn't go to church regularly, hardly ever really, because her family isn't the church-going type and she usually doesn't have the time.

When we first started dating, she was made quite aware that I was an atheist. We had a few conversations about religion, she had a lot of questions for me and, understandably, me answering those questions probably gave her a lot of doubts about her own beliefs that she hadn't had before. I did my best to not pressure her or challenge her beliefs. She's younger and more impressionable than I am, so I didn't want to influence her beliefs. Don't get me wrong, she's a very intelligent person but she can be very insecure about her beliefs and self-worth in school, work, etc. She often is very worried about what others think about her, especially her family, me and other people close to her. I really, really love her and I didn't want to risk creating a wedge between us on the whole religion issue. So, I only talk about religion if she initiates the conversation.

Occasionally, she talks to one of her sisters (who's a serious holy-roller) or, worse, gets dragged to church with her and the next time I see her I get a conversation about how she's ""worried for my soul"" etc., etc. and doesn't know if we should be together. In the past we've had our arguments over this kind of stuff, but we always move past it in a day or two and everything is back to normal. In the past I've considered it a small price to pay for being with her as she's more important to me than God or the lack of a god, or just about anything.


**So, enough background. On to what happened:...**

I'm sitting at home today, playing some 'puter games. She shows up at my place and kinda meanders around for a while. We make some idle chit-chat, throw things at the cat, eat lunch, etc., then after about 45 minutes or so she says ""she wants to talk"". I'm not expecting anything bad. Why should I be? Things have been great! But then she tells me, ""I went to church with my sister today..."" and immediately I'm like, ""Oh shit, here we go.""

Sure enough, she's decided this time that she needs to ""search within herself for God's plan"" and it has suddenly entered her mind that ""maybe God doesn't want us to be together"". This is pretty upsetting for me, because we have had, in the past, a pretty healthy relationship - we have fun together, good conversation, similar sense of humor, good sex life (which God doesn't seem to be bothered by, conveniently). I thought things were going great...amazing, actually. I was in a serious, 4-year relationship before this one. Was single for nearly 2 years before meeting my current girlfriend. I love her and want to be with her for the long haul. I've been preparing to pop the question after she graduates this spring. Haven't bought a ring yet, but I've been looking and putting money aside for it...

But now she does this, again...and it only seems to get worse each time it happens. Now she's telling me that she doesn't know what to do, and that the Bible says you can't marry an atheist, and that even if it didn't say it she doesn't think it's a good idea because it would eventually tear us apart. I can't help but point out the irony to her. I don't see what the problem could be down the road. I have no issue with her beliefs - it's her choice. If we were to have kids, I have no problem with them going to church so long as they have the choice in young adulthood to decide what their own beliefs are and be free to be Christian, atheist, Hindu or whatever the hell they want. Unless she's decided that it's ""Christian or GTFO"" for me, then we shouldn't have a problem.

So I feel betrayed. Betrayed because I'm so emotionally invested in her, so in love with who she is as a human being, that her religious beliefs don't even enter the equation for me. I can't understand why she doesn't feel the same way. Because a similar conversation has occurred in the past and is now happening again in a much more serious tone, I've now built up resentment towards her and the whole issue. I thought we had a healthy, happy, respectful relationship. I see her persistence on this issue and continually bringing it up after I believed it had been resolved as her sabotaging our relationship. I'm starting to wonder, out loud, if there's not something else she's unhappy with with me, or us and she's just using the religion thing as an escape ladder so she doesn't have to address some other issue.

She says she has to ""think about it"" and ""figure it out for [herself]"" but I've been hearing that for over a year now. I'm really tired of hearing about it at all and I'm starting to get angry. After the argument we had tonight I'm almost ready to say to hell with it, hoping that maybe seeing some consequences for these actions will help her snap out of it.

No amount of logic I use seems to work on her. She just deflects it using vague references to God's plan for her and insists that we have a problem when the only problem I can see is her bigotry towards my beliefs (or a lack of belief, as it stands).



I hope this made sense. I'm in a state that's difficult to describe right now.

What can you advise, reddit?

**UPDATE-the-SHUPDATE:** Hey, thanks for all the comments and advice, guys and gals. It's been really helpful for me to get a third person perspective on this and I really appreciate it. I'm glad I decided to post on Reddit. Good responses. Except for that one guy who suggested the elaborate butt sex caper. ಠ_ಠ

For those that asked, we have discussed marriage quite a bit in the past and she's always been excited about the prospect of us spending our lives together. So, I don't think that's the problem (but it's still a possibility, I suppose). We've also discussed kids in the past, and I think that does worry her a bit. I don't think she believes that the ""let them make up their own minds"" school of thought will work and would rather we indoctrinate them one way or the other.

To the person who wondered, I always let her know that I would rather her make up her own mind about things than ask me what I think. She's a very indecisive person, which I noticed early on, so I've always tried to encourage her to be more self-sufficient. Plus mindlessness is a huuuuuge turn-off.

In the end it doesn't really matter so much *why* she's doing what she's doing. There's not a whole lot I can do to affect that, she determines her motives and I'm not keen on manipulating that or trying to psychologically analyze her.

I think Skitrel gave the advice that made the most sense to me. I'm just going to tell her that a decision has to be made and it's hers to make. It's not one of those things that she can play the fence on and I'm not going to sit around too long waiting for her to make up her mind. If our relationship is going to flourish and turn into a sustainable marriage then she has to get past this and accept that I am who I am and that that's not going to change, no matter how much she wishes it. I love her, but I won't sacrifice my principles or my identity. If that's not ok then I guess we go our separate ways.

**TL;DR: Girlfriend of 2 years suddenly decides that she's not ok with my atheism, even though I'm perfectly ok and respectful of her beliefs as a Christian. It doesn't affect how I feel about her, and I hope she would feel the same about me. She says it means we may not be able to be together because it ""may not be God's plan"" that we get married, since I'm a heretic. I feel pissed off, betrayed and like she's wasted my time.

He went from the golden boy to target in a matter of minutes.  I am deeply disturbed by this.  The drama (heel vs face) aspect, the WWE angles, are getting out of hand.  This is a sport with the best athletes in the world....we don't need Kos acting like a buffoon to sell tickets.  It doesn't always have to be personal and there doesn't need to be a storyline.  These fighters don't get in to fighting because they hate everyone else fighting....it's a competition.  

That said, is anyone else completely turned off by a GSP vs Silva superfight?  I think the whole thing puts GSP at a severe disadvantage.  Size wise, he's not a large WW...and Silva is perfectly capable of fighting at 185 or 205.  Not everyone can do that.  And a mere handful of minutes after the fight Dana's tone is that of basically calling out GSP saying he should move up for the superfight.  It's my opinion that Dana is trying to force GSP, through pride or honor, to step up to 185 (outside of his natural fighting weight window) so he can sell some tickets, and I don't think it's fair to either fighter or the fans.  It's the UFC's job to put GSP and Silva in with the best fighters in their respective weight classes.  If they are unable to do that, that shouldn't reflect on either of the champions as ""Well they just need to start doing other things to be dominant.""

So, I attempted the at home screen printing. I didnt have freezer paper (can not find it anywhere in NYC) so I used wax paper. The wax paper did NOT stick to the fabric at all. So i ended up taping the pieces down. Then I sprayed the fabric paint - which was SO much harder to control than the website says. I used a different brand, though, so maybe that's why (again - original brand impossible to find in NYC.) Also, because the tape wasn't holding very well I couldnt take the shirt off the ironing bored... so now there is a ton of paint on the ironing bored. Hooray... i don't know how im going to get that off.

1.  Everyone in the whole school hates Harry when his name pops up, even (and especially) Ron.  Harry has saved the school three times to this point, and obviously people are trying very hard to kill and undermine him.  Seriously??  Wouldn't throwing his name into a goblet and forcing him to compete in a ludicrously dangerous event be an obvious choice?  Everyone hates him again even after being proved wrong for hating him during the serpent speak incident.

2.  Is the staff of Hogwarts evil or incompetent?  They HAVE to be one of these choices, plain and simple.  So many teachers there have a purely evil agenda, and don't hide it very well.  Is Dumbledore that stupid that he can't tell this?  Does he not care?  They have potions and herbs and things that can see truth.  

3.  Why are the teachers constantly trying to kill the students?  I actually think almost everything bad that happened in the first 3 movies could have been prevented with competent guardianship, but this movie escalated from negligence to intent.  Seriously, the whole dragon thing???  Then they try to drown a bunch of students.  If Harry didn't actually free both of those kids would one of them have died?  Most action movies have a protagonist fighting against bad guys.  I honestly think 90% of the danger Harry Potter has faced from the first four movies has been from the faculty.

Worst of all, we get this 15 minute graveyard scene which was utterly boring.  I honestly fell asleep even though I wasn't tired, so I will admit I could have missed something interesting.  

I really felt that the whole time was spent on danger manufactured by the teachers, which leaves no suspense whatsoever since we know that Harry will not die.  What is to like?

I don't want to say anything dramatic or insane, I just want to email things, show her funny things I've found online, talk about life, whatever.  Nothing big.  I don't even care if she responds, I just want the right to say it...  But I can't.  She has a restraining order against me.  Not for ever being violent, just for ""harassing"" her.  It's a long story, and yes, in the past I was a huge asshole in various ways (and also good in various ways, I'm not evil, I've just been very confused for a long time), but all I've ever done is annoy her, I was never violent in even the smallest way.  Every email I send will cost me a year in jail, that's how restraining orders work, even just for harassment...

I can't control myself.  The impulse to communicate is incredibly intense, and if I don't act on it, I slowly lose my mind.  I don't expect anyone to understand, but just try to picture trying to hold your breath as long as you can.  You can do it for a while, but eventually that *need* to breathe becomes so intense that you just can't think of anything else but that.  That's how powerful this compulsion is to write her a text message or an email.  It's unbearable.  I already spent four days in jail over a text message, so I know that even one more day in jail is torture for me.

I really can't see any way to escape this.  There's no reasoning with her.  There's no way to ask her to accept being slightly annoyed just to save my life.  To even ask her that is a violation, and thus time in jail.  I see no way out except taking my own life.

I DO NOT want to die, but I prefer death than even one day in jail, and I know before the year is out I'll send an email, no matter how hard I try to fight the compulsion.

I feel like I'm trapped in an equation with no solution.  I don't know what to do other than this.  When the Cyanide arrives, I'm going to take a small vacation, far away from where anyone can find me, and I'll mix the solution with a glass of wine and see if this universe is really the end of it all or not.

I want to live, but how can I?  I don't think any of you can help, there's nothing at all that can help me, but I want to write this just once.  Maybe someone has some solution I've yet to consider.  I feel so helpless...

This is more backstory on me than directly related to the question at hand. 

More recently, I've been feeling more like I'd like to date/develop a deeper relationship.  But I'm so old relative to the dating game that I am a bit clueless as where to start.  I also think that I don't have any personal need to date casually.  Not that I want to find some random guy and make a five-year-commitment off the bat for the sake of a commitment, just that I don't feel the need to develop romantic relationships unless I sense a real connection.  And while I think that I would fit with a pretty good variety of personalities, I do have some idea of certain dealbreakers that I know would bother me.  I'm wondering: are these too demanding?  Or, alternatively, where am I most likely to meet someone who fits these criteria?

1) Intellectually curious, and takes some level of pride in intelligence, continuous learning, intelligent conversation/debate, etc., on a wide variety of topics.

2) Kind.  A person who cares genuinely and deeply for the people in their life, and is generally charitable.

3) Good sense of humor - obviously subjective

4) Likes either dogs or cats

5) Good taste in movies and music and likes to read at least sometimes.  Taste is obviously also subjective, and is also not limited to what I like.  Should probably like either folk, jazz/blues, classical, alternative/indie or classic rock, though, music-wise.  If he shared my love for Tom Waits, I'd probably fall head over heels right there.

6) Not devoutly religious, or at least aware of or skeptical about religious basis.

7) Main hobby isn't video games.  I know this probably sounds kind of bitchy/stereotypically girly.  I like playing myself sometimes, although my lack of spatial intelligence means I'm not much good at any system more recent than super nintendo/sega genesis, but I know it's not something I could relate to and it seems like a waste of time instead of time that could be spent working on something in the ""real world"".  I suspect I'll take some heat for this one.  Also, key word is ""main hobby"" not a moratorium completely.  The other component to this is that because I know I feel this way, real gamer guys just wouldn't be happy with me either, and it's not like I want to change someone.

8) Politically on the liberal end of the spectrum and environmentally concerned, though no need for radicalism of any kind.

9) Enjoys board games of some kind.

10) Not pretentious or interested in social capital/entertaining/some kind of high class/rich lifestyle.  A modestly oriented, more lower-working-middle-class kind of person.

11) Isn't cynical about Christmastime.  By this I mean takes some level of joy in the season (or Hanukkah if Jewish).  I say this because I have struggled with depression in my life, and it's one of the things I'm most purely happy about, and I feel that if I was with someone constantly bringing it down, it would be somewhat bad for my mental health.

12) Doesn't use any kind of recreational drugs or smoke.  Drinking alcohol in reasonable amounts is fine.

As I went through that, it seemed like a lot, but also not a lot.  I could imagine a lot of different kinds of people who would fit these descriptions.  But then again, maybe it'd be hard to meet them.  Of course, one has to wonder whether this kind of person would be interested in me, a shy nerd-girl who fits these categories along with being somewhat crafty/artistic and liking writing, puzzles (both logical and jigsaw), and being somewhat childlike in my love of snow, children's books, and surprises.  I'm also overly self-critical, somewhat lazy/messy, and don't believe in withholding criticism because of my relationship to a person.  I've been called pretty by more than one person, but I don't generally think of myself that way, so that's a pretty hard call.

So to sum up, what's the best way to meet a thoughtful, unpretentious guy in his twenties?

EDIT: So, just to clarify, when I say ""criteria"" I'm somewhat loose with them.  But, this list should give you some kind of idea of a certain kind of person who generally comes to mind; that's what I'm looking for.  For instance, a guy who was really kind would trump a lot of the more specific criteria.  It's not like I'd meet some lovely guy and find out he wasn't that into Battleship and go, ""Oh-sorry!  Not interested anymore!""  It should fit loosely, not tightly.",-1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

He didn't disclose many details but I already knew what was up--he looks and acts the same as he's always, but you only have to combine ""experimental medication,"" the vague notion that he might not be here in a year, and the lifestyle I've always known him for to put the three together.  

We go out to the bar about once every week or so, and every so often at the end of the night things seem to take a turn for the worse with him.  The line is always ""I'm tired"" and I've ran out of things to say.  But it's not like the tired that a healthy person feels after a hard night of drinking, it's the kind of tired you don't wake up from.  

His scene isn't my usual--I basically only drink around him, cut myself off early and provide a safe ride home.  But thinking about this, his life revolves around drinking to the point where we joke that he never has anything to eat nor drink that doesn't have alcohol.  In fact, since his HIV diagnosis a few years ago, I've probably only actually seen him eat a handful of times. 

And I heard the line again tonight.  ""I'm tired.""  It hurts, because I know he is--he works hard as fuck, has more personality and game in his finger than I do my whole body, but doing what he does five times a week will match anyone with their limits.  

I'm 28 and I've only known one person personally to have died of AIDS.  NC was healthy one year, and gone the next, and it still bugs me--he died at 26.   

NC's death changed my notion of things.  It's as if people seem to forget that HIV hasn't been cured yet, that it's manageable, blah blah blah.  And I know plenty of people with HIV--two dozen around--but none in the situation my friend is in.  

NC and I weren't that close, but my friend and I are.  I'm the only one that knows of my friend's condition.   

To me, it's the mental that will kill him.    I can't laugh or pass it off with my usual ""you'll be fine"" because I know he won't just ""be fine"" now.  

I don't know what to say after this.  I'm not raw, more like stoic and detached.   I may be moving in a few months, and I don't want to hug my friend for the last time when I go.

Specifically, in heroic 5mans when there are trash pulls of between 2 and 5 mobs, how do you maximize your DPS?

I have tried nuking down just one mob at a time - but 75% of the time I aggro if I do that. 

I tried putting up IS/Moonfire on all 5 mobs and then nuking - but that seems to be lower DPS. 

For now, I usually put up IS/Moonfire on 1 or 2 mobs, and then nuke hard on a third. My hope is that in the time it took for me to do that, the tank has generated an aggro lead.

I'm just slightly OCD and I like to have a plan for the most efficient cast sequence. For bosses, I've got it down.

What happens is thus: I'll get a hangnail, or some other break in the skin. This will leave a ragged flap of dead skin. I'll bite the skin off.

Soon, my fingertips look like beef jerky around the nails: ragged, red, and sometimes bleeding.

it seems like i am already ""in"" but there's more - she knows i have a gf and she even saw her in person a few days ago. not to mention we work together. other than that there hasn't been much indication of interest or lack thereof, aside from the flirting.

123123,"The theory as I understand it is this:  The middle class lives, for the most part, paycheck to paycheck.  If you give them money, they will immediately pump it into the economy through retail sales.  This in turn, creates more retail/ production jobs and stimulates this portion of the economy.

The major criticism of giving money to rich people is they will simply keep it.  This would be sound logic if there wasn't a basic misunderstanding of the way rich people ""keep"" their money.  They generally tend to invest it.  It's not as if they throw it on a pile in their basement, they're rich because they're smart enough to make their money work for them.  Don't those investments do more to stimulate the economy in a much broader way than simply putting money into retail sales?  Please correct me, I want to hear the other side of this argument.

As a side note, I'm Canadian.  There is an argument to be made that stimulating retail sales in Canada doesn't do anything for us because nearly all of our retailers are American.  Our best hope to stimulate the economy is to give rich people money and incentivize domestic investing.  No?

123406,"Was at the local rock gym yesterday and while I was belaying I noticed a fellow belayers belaying technique was a bit flawed.  He was using a gri-gri and belaying a small group of young adults on top rope.  Every once and a while he would try to talk to the climber out of a sticking point by taking his hands off the brake of the locked gri-gri and illustrating the motion to get through whatever crux he was working through.

This made me cringe.

So I wasn't sure what, if anything I should say.  It's bad belaying, but the risk is relatively low once the gri-gri is already locked so I kind of let it slide and made a mental note not to ask that guy for a belay.  It's kind of terrible though as he was showing a group of new climbers some bad technique that is probably works 99% of the time.  

I've intervened before when it became clear that someone is immediately at risk.  One time at the gym I was belaying next to a new person using an ATC.  As he was belaying I could here a constantly clinking of his ATC against the biner.  Upon closer inspection he only threaded through one end of the biner and essentially was just holding the rope.  In that case I intervened.

But this case was different it's bad form and increased risk but the person wasn't in immediate peril.  What would you do?

We thought we found a great middle ground where they could enjoy Santa cartoons and stories because they saw him as fun pretend like Mickey mouse or Winnie the pooh. Now my son comes home one day and tells me that Santa is real because his teacher told him so. I was a bit pissed off when he recounted the story of his teacher convincing him that Santa is real. He knows not to tell the other kids that he isn't real because we have explained to him that some kids believe he is real and it wouldn't be nice to convince them otherwise, but from what he told us his teacher had them write letters to Santa, my son wrote his letter with the teachers helper and asked if he could take it home to me. They told him they were going to mail it to Santa, he said that was silly because mommy said Santa is make-believe and they proceeded to tell him that Santa is real and that only kids who believe in Santa get presents from Santa. I'm quite pissed off and I have a meeting (already set for the end of the semester) and I'm not sure how to bring it up. I like his teacher, she was my teacher in Gr.2 and my sisters teacher in SK and I don't want to make a big deal about it or cause a problem but I feel like they've stomped on my wishes just because it isn't the ""norm"". Should I bring it up or should I just assure my son that Santa is make-believe? He's pretty pissed at me right now because he thinks I've stopped him from getting more presents and I have absolutely no plans to go and buy more presents just to conform to this cultural expectation. I feel like I am being forced to give up my beliefs on keeping presents for Christmas in the background to spending time with family and everywhere we look it's being shoved in his face that he should be getting lots of presents if he is good, which we have been able to minimize and combat until this happened at school. 

So Mommit what do I do? Do I bring it up with his teacher or just let it slide and continue with what we were doing before? I feel like if this was reversed and the teacher told my kid Santa wasn't real there would be outrage where most people (my parents and friends) are telling me to just move past it and not mention it.

it feels like my life is falling apart. I've lost almost all of my friends who i thought were close to me. so few of my friends actually talk to me, but seem to just forget about me when i'm out of sight. I feel so lonely when I see them all doing stuff together and not including me. one of my old floor mates from last year actually said that he only remembered me as ""Eric's roommate"" (Eric was my old roommate who was my best friend, the best roommate anyone could ask for) and that really cut me hard. My friends at home are all messed up too; my ex won't talk to me anymore; my best friend since we were 10 is now a raving pussy who can't stop whining about his gf; no one returns my texts anymore to do stuff on break, it just blows. 

this past fall I busted my ass so hard to get better grades (I slacked off last year a bit), but no matter how I worked I kept getting subpar grades. I'm really fucking smart but no matter what I do I never get good exam grades and it fucks up my semester averages. every effort never was enough, and no matter how hard I was working, the next day it didn't matter and I blew it by not seeing obvious that I would see as soon as it was handed back to me the next class. I would even be helping my classmates understand material, and then I get that same material wrong on the exam, it fucking kills me.

All the girls I get close to end up just telling me that I'm more like a brother and we are just friends.  

It just seems like it's not worth it anymore, I feel like I've let everyone down and just don't want to keeping fighting it anymore. I don't want to give up, but I want to find what works for me, because I don't think this is anymore.

124917,"I've been in a very happy relationship with my GF for over 5 years now. It's always been a very sexual relationship, including a long phase where she often wanted much more sex than I could handle. As of about 6 months ago, her sex drive has taken a sudden nose-dive. I'm lucky if she's in the mood more than once every 2 weeks or so. It's unfortunately gotten to the point that whenever I'm outwardly horny, it seems to turn her OFF, as it is percieved as ""pressure"" to have sex... but sometimes I can't help myself because I'm intensely attracted to her, even after 5 years. Now, I know this kind of sounds like a normal ""sexless"" phase that most long-term relationships get into, except for one thing that bugs me. She seems to think that she's going through a hormonal phase where her libido is diminished, and if we wait it out, she's sure it will turn around... but when she's drunk, she ALWAYS wants sex - she becomes an animal. It's totally hot, and the sex is great, but she almost feels like a different person. I usually indulge, but I'm starting to feel guilty, wondering if it's what she really wants. She actually drinks fairly rarely, and I don't want to have to get the woman I love ""liquored up"" whenever I want her. What could this be? Has she developed some sort of insecurity that she can only get through with alcohol? Talking to her about it is difficult because she's very sensitive to ""pressure"" about her sex drive. Thoughts?

EDIT: Forgot this was Reddit. No, I don't think she is cheating. And I trust her. Rather than have this thread spiral  into an argument as to whether or not I'm in denial about my GF being a cheating ho how about I rephrase my question: ""Aside from the unlikely possibility that I'm being cheated on, what ELSE could be the causes/solutions to my problem?""

125959,"I'll try to give the quick story. I'm currently 29/m 5'9"" 175lbs. 2 years ago I was over 200lbs (I think my highest recorded weight was 207lbs) and knew that I needed to do something serious about losing it and keeping it off.  In the past I had been an athlete, but hadn't done much physical since college.  After that realization, I found things like Crossfit (love it or hate it, it has helped me find better things in fitness) and the Paleo diet. 

I've made tremendous gains on my core lifts. **Current PRs being**: Squat 5x3 - 292.5lbs, Deadlift 1RM - 385lbs, Press 1RM - 125lbs (weak I know). 5k run PR - 26:57.

Through all of this though, I have had some injuries that have been major setbacks.

* Hip injury after running too much of a distance - Out of most working out for 3 months.
* Neck injury from what I thought was sleeping wrong (more on this later) - Out of doing most workouts for 3 months
* Some sort of elbow tendinitis that put me out of anything upper body for 6 weeks
* Currently coming out of a shoulder injury - prevented me from doing anything except running for the last 2 months. 

This current injury, as it turns out, stems from being extremely tight in the chest/lats/thoracic spine/teres major, which limits my mobility in my shoulders. This explains my terrible pressing ability, and also explains how I easily torqued my neck.  I'm currently in some very good PT and on my way to ""normal"" mobility.

Through all of this, I am grateful that I have made a change in priorities in my life, and will continue to keep fitness a priority.  However, I have still never achieved any sort of flat stomach... which is where the last of whatever fat on my body will probably leave me.  I suspect that this is because I have not once had a good solid 6 months of training in a row.  I know that a lot of it is diet, but when you're in an injured state, your desire goes out the window.

Anyone ever feel like everything is going against their gains?

Maybe it will help to just write about this, so this post will probably be really long.  I'm 27 and I live in a depressingly small town in Illinois.  Up until April of this year I was working in a terrible job, but I put up with it because it paid the bills and kept me in my studio apartment.  Something in me snapped and I just couldn't put up with the bullshit anymore, so I erupted in a performance review meeting and got fired.  I haven't worked since, and have only put in half-hearted attempts to find work.  I was sapped of the last bit of motivation I had because of my experience in that job.  I have had desires to murder my ex-supervisor who I blame for me getting fired, even though it was probably mostly my fault.  Around the same time I was in my first relationship, and had my first kiss and sexual encounter.  When we were getting intimate I couldn't ""perform"" and it basically traumatized me to the point I tell myself I must never go trough dating/relationships again.  Also, since March '09 I have been going to the University of Phoenix online to get a degree in Criminal Justice.  Since that time I learned how terrible this school's reputation is and that I have wasted thousands of hours in getting a degree from a terrible school in a field I'm not even interested in anymore.  I wanted to be a cop for a while, but after serving as an Auxiliary officer I just couldn't handle it.  I'm far too stupid to do that job (or any other job), and I can't be in social situations without wanting to kill myself afterward.  So earlier this year I started planning my suicide; a gunshot to the head with the duty gun I was using.  My family urged me to go to therapy, which I did for about 4 months.  It was a terrible experience and I won't go back.  I was diagnosed with Social Anxiety Disorder, and they put me on 50mg of Imipramine plus Xanax, but it just isn't helping.  My family basically forced me to give them my gun, and now I have no access to it.  Last week I had to move back into my parents house because I ran out of the student loan money that I was using to pay rent.  I am a miserable failure and now I'm trying to decide on the least painful way to die.  I'm thinking of swallowing all the pills I have left.  What's incredibly pathetic is the fact that the only thing that makes me want to carry on is video games, and not my relationships with other people.

Religion is what you practice and believe in at church. 

It is a hope and faith of something, someone, etc...

It separates people and causes arguments. Religion usually includes the ""past"", a god or goddess, and some special person. 

People will argue over what happens after death because they were raised believing something.  Religion does not have proof, just faith.

And he said ""blow up the rocket"". So I fired the RPG thingie that luckily popped up (for some reason, but let's not question that) just when we needed it. I fired it up, I fired it low, I fired it high. I fired it with my settings, I fired it with default settings, I fired it about 60 times in all. Really. It was not fun. At all.

I never managed to alter its trajectory because *as soon as I fired it* the display was always the same : ""you fucked up"" 'or something to that effect). Which was displayed about half a second after I fired.

Anyway, that game now left my windows partition. All 8 Gb of it. More space for something that will hopefully be worth it.

So all in all, COD black ops was roughly 20 minutes of completely directive gameplay (shoot this, run there), and attempt 60 times this thing, although whatever you do you'll get the very same display (but still do it again or else you're screwed).

Well. Ok. In a very circomvoluted way, this game passes my ""motion picture"" test.

127291,"*I lurk here quite a bit, just using a throwaway to cover my bases.*     

I have begun posts about my relationship with my boyfriend many times, but I always get frustrated writing it all out and whatever issue we're having usually blows over before I can finish. I'm getting this all out now because I am graduating in a few days and will probably be faced with some big decisions in the next few months. 

I will be 23 next month, and my boyfriend is 32. We met online (ya, rly) and after a couple weeks of talking on AIM (during which I was reluctant to take him seriously) and a week talking on the phone every night (during which he won me over so to speak), we met in person and have been together for almost a year now. We have technically been long distance the entire time-- he lives near my hometown where my family still lives, and I am a five hour drive north in the college town where I've worked and gone to school for the past two and a half years. 

This has been my first real adult long-term relationship. Until him **I had never seen myself as a relationship-type person and always felt like my school and work should come first (and in many ways I still feel like this).** I have always been insanely independent-- emotionally and financially as much as possible. For these reasons I work too much and take on way more than I should. I'm currently working two jobs (one to pay the bills and another to gain some experience in my field), just finished a volunteer/work experience position I've had for the past two years and at the moment I'm busting my ass to finish two huge projects and study for an exam so I can graduate in less than a week. 

As my boyfriend will jokingly admit, he is the opposite of me. He has lived with his mother his entire life and due to a couple health issues has been on disability for a while now, so he hasn't worked in years. **This bugs me to the point that writing this out is driving me crazy.** I have brought up my issues with this before and it hasn't gone well. We often talk about getting him off all the medication he is on (for stuff I'm not even clear about anymore) and figuring things out so he can go back to school and get a job but so far nothing has come of it. I'm not materialistic in the least, I never expect gifts and I am more than ok with splitting restaurant checks with him, but it has gotten to the point that I am paying for more things while he has spent his monthly check on graduation, holiday and birthday presents for me that I insist over and over again I do not need. 

My main issues with my boyfriend and our relationship stem from his insane insecurity. He has been cheated on in the past and his father left him and his mother when he was very young (not uncommon I know, but it's pretty clear he's never addressed the issues he has with it). The fact that we are long distance doesn't help matters. **Since he doesn't work he really doesn't do much of anything during the day but call me, wait for me to call him or text me to complain that I'm not picking up the phone, or paying more attention to something else that isn't him.** If I don't pick up the phone I'm usually accused of ""being with someone else"" even though he knows I'm at work or in class. When I do pick up, about half the time the first thing I'm asked is ""Who's there?"" which started off as a serious question, became a joke for a little while and now annoyingly persists despite my asking him to stop. To his credit, his suspicion isn't completely unfounded-- when we first started talking I told him I would be scared that I would cheat on him if we were together, because way back then I had a couple friends-with-benefits situations I hadn't ended. But since we've been together I have been perfectly faithful and now that it's been almost a year this shit is getting old. Aside from cheating accusations, he is so heavy-handed with the ""I love you""'s and other terms of endearment that they've started to lose all meaning. At least seven times a day (really, I've counted) I'll receive texts simply saying ""love me."" If I don't respond in a reasonable amount of time the texts will continue until I finally say ""I love you."" This is on top of him doing the same exact thing on the phone constantly. I have no problem with saying I love you and I hate that it's gotten to the point that it annoys me so much. 

Looking back on it, he was much worse in the earlier days of our relationship but my boyfriend is still needy and clingy to the point that I can't handle it anymore. He has talked about being together forever and getting married from the first time we met in person, which freaked me out at first but I've somehow gotten used to it. He often asks if I will take care of him (meaning keep track of getting his meds, cleaning up after him etc. much like his mom has been doing his entire life), and then insists that he will take care of me. **But I don't want to be taken care of!** I rarely bring it up, but I feel I am way too young to be talking about this kind of stuff. I don't want to be in a relationship solely because he ""needs me."" I want to be wanted, not needed, if that makes any sense.

Bringing up issues with him is always a challenge. He has a tendency to mock my friends (the few I have left after focusing on school, work and him for the past year). I tell him nearly everything, so he knows about my roommates (good friends of mine since grade school) and their recent indiscretions and trips off the deep end. Despite my insistence that they are still my friends and the fact that they have never done anything to him personally, he calls them ""worthless whores."" I have several close male friends who are either gay or questionable, and because of this or his insecurities he calls them all faggots, which really bothers me. These are just two of the most prominent examples of him demonizing my friends based on things I tell him. When I recently asked him to stop calling one of my best friends a faggot (only to me, when my friend did nothing but post some pictures on Facebook), he immediately flew off the handle that I was defending my friend over him, and accused me of not respecting his feelings. **How me asking him not to call my friend a faggot hurts his feelings, I will never comprehend.** Most of our arguments start like this: I carefully bring up an issue I have, tell him how it makes me feel and how I'd like him to change it, and he accuses me of being selfish, disrespecting his feelings and invariably hangs up on me. 

The most recent instance of this was just this morning-- he has had a habit of leaving insanely corny posts on my Facebook wall that I have always insisted should be private because I have a ton of school and work friends who don't need to be seeing that crap (plus it drives me nuts when I see other people do it, and looks immature to me). I have asked him to stop for the past couple months but it finally took my mom calling me this morning and gently pointing out that it looks weird for me to put my foot down and ask him to stop. He says he will stop, but it took a lot of arguing and I still don't think he completely gets it. 

Writing all this out makes me understand why there are so many people asking for advice like I am. Despite all of this I love him very much and he is an amazingly sweet person. **Unfortunately, I can't figure out if I'm a bad person for staying with him this long even though I am generally unhappy, or a bad person for wanting to dump him more and more lately.** As I said I am graduating, and my boyfriend is under the impression that I will be moving back in with my family to be near him, despite the many times I've told  him this will most likely not be happening since I have two jobs here I'm planning on working while looking for a full time job. I have been looking at jobs out of state so far, and my boyfriend is set on going with me though I have serious doubts about this and no idea how it would work money-wise.
 Being long distance only makes things more confusing-- the few weekends and weeks that we get to spend completely together are wonderful (until about the fifth day when I crave my privacy) and I seem to forget all these issues until we are apart and I'm doing my own thing while all this crap starts up again. 

**So what I'm really asking here is for some of your best general advice, R_A.** As I said this is my first real relationship, and I don't have many friends I feel I can talk this over with as I've always been weirdly private when it comes to this stuff. I just want to know if issues like this are normal, if I'm being reasonable about wanting to end it and how the hell I could even go about breaking up with him. He tells me over and over again that I am his life and he would be nothing without me. This stopped being flattering a long time ago and now it just scares me because I don't see how I could ever break up with him without feeling tremendous guilt. **I feel responsible for his entire happiness and I have a really strong feeling it shouldn't be like this.** Help?

*(I've skipped a lot of stuff I initially really wanted to include but writing this has started bumming me out. I can give more examples for anyone who is interested.)*

127780,"First off, this isn't a ""pity me"" post.
I'm just looking for insight and suggestions on how to turn my life around. I just feel like these past events and current situations are relevant to how I've ended up today.

- I've been sexually assaulted two times in my past, and after breaking up with an ex-boyfriend, I was locked in his basement and raped/beaten within an inch of my life. The sexual assaults were by family members, I came out and told my family but they deemed it a ""cry for attention"" and said they'd disown me if I went to the police. After the incident with my ex, I didn't go to the police because.. honestly, I wanted vengeance. I wanted to kill him and show him every bit of agony that I experienced. I know that was stupidity on my part and I should have taken legal action, but that has since been three years ago so I feel as there is no hope for that. I was also physically/emotionally abused by my family most of my life.
- I've been on medications and through therapy for about seven years. I've been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and it's something I've had to live with for the past four years. I am extremely distrusting of people's motives, have severe anxiety (to the point where something little can set me off and I'll end up throwing up and feeling like the world is closing in on me). I never felt like therapy or medication helped me, but even if I wanted to pursue it as an option again, I have no insurance or no job currently. I can tell in regard to my mental illness, I've made a lot of progress by myself these past few years. I am a lot better at handling the delusions, but the paranoia is always there. I've since become a hermit, pushed everyone out of my life, out of fear that I'm a terrible person not worthy of friendships or companionship. Everyone that has seen the ""real"" side of me has cut me out of their life.
- A year ago this month, I attempted to commit suicide and was found locked in the bathroom by my father, who took me to the ER. I almost died and had to be resuscitated. I'm not currently suicidal, just.. very empty and apathetic a lot of the time. I feel like my entire life is just doing something to fill up the days.
- I feel like any man that tries to befriend or date me only does so because I'm ""pretty"". This insecurity stems from my ex-boyfriend emotionally demeaning me, telling me what a fuck-up I am, and that my only redeemable quality is that I've been blessed with ""a beautiful exterior shell"". 

I've been going to school full-time trying to make something of myself. Still, I'm very depressed and spend the majority of my time locked in my room playing video games, reading, or browsing reddit. I find it hard to make friends because of my paranoia and the fact I'm probably very intimidating and hard to approach to most people.

I just want to know what I can do to change.
I'm so sick of not remembering what it feels like to be happy.

Whenever I find hardrives or even memory cards I always snoop through them to see what is on them.

You never know what you're gonna find, I've found anything from pics of a women getting dressed before their wedding to a rather attractive older woman spread out on what looked like a hotel bed. It isn't all porn, sometimes you can read interesting stories or poems that people have written, see interesting doodles or legitimately artistic photos that they've taken.

Well, the wait may be over. I received a letter today from the office of the Consulate General of Canada stating that our Designated Immigration Officer has concern over the status of our conjugal relationship. Since my girlfriend and I are in no real rush to marry (and since her mother doesn't want us to get married for the sole purpose of me becoming a resident of Canada), we applied as conjugal partners. By definition, we fit the bill. We've been in a committed relationship for over a year, rely on one another emotionally, and we're socially involved in one another's lives. The only thing we've not done is combine our income, which we found would be nigh impractical as I am an American citizen and she's Canadian. Also, we both provide for ourselves.

The officer from the immigration office didn't outright say that my application was denied, just that they had concerns and that the onus was upon me to provide evidence that we qualify as conjugal partners. Insofar, we've submitted plane ticket information (for the thousands of dollars we've spent on that), chat logs, emails, photos of us together on vacation, car rental receipts, receipts from vacation spots together, legally certified statements from our parents confirming our relationship status, and a statement from her mother saying that she had helped purchase a condo and is making payments for us to live there.

What should I do next? I have since emailed the offices in Buffalo asking what evidence we should provide and in what manner, though somewhere on their website they said it could take upwards of 28 days to respond to email requests. The letter I received didn't indicate any direct response channel (email, phone, physical address) to my Designated Immigration Officer, even though it seemed he or she was asking for a direct response.

That’s all anyone ever does. No one has the courage to press the emergency stop and put the fire out once and for all. Just a bunch of Tom Ritchies walking around day-to-day, strung out on reality: Glassy-eyed with the tears of achievement and prestige, face wrinkled with anger at those different than us. Most of us happy to strive for conformity, and when we reach it, well – that’s success. 

That is what it means to achieve and rise to the occasion in our twisted mutant world. All you have to do is conform and make every concession of comfort humanly possible until the day your pointless life reaches finality. There’s no finite measure of well-doing and happiness in an infinity comprised entirely of lies and bullshit, but no one wants to hear that. It’s much more wonderful to forget the prospect of destiny and pretend we’re all immortal players in a role we've each casted for ourselves.

I have a bit of a musical conundrum. I am deeply in need of new music, but recently I haven't found much that I can really get fully into. What I look for in music is a complex mood - a unique conveyance of emotion (usually tempered with hopelessness) - articulated by heavy guitars and intricate guitarwork.

I'm not a fan of the eternal blastbeat - I certainly enjoy blastbeating but like my drumming to be dynamic.  Mix the blastbeats in with your drumming, don't mix drumming in with your blastbeats.  I also don't enjoy low-quality sound, as is common in black metal (I can still enjoy black metal, though).  

I've recently been hanging out in the sludge / stoner doom camps, and have recently been spilling into post-rock, but I'm willing to go to most subgenres of metal.

On this particular occasion, said friend was helping with the remodel and demoing the roof when, I shit you not, a bed pillow-size bag of weed came flying down from the ceiling. She didn't want to get the workers in trouble, and the family was probably out of town or something but you can't really be like ""hey, found this for ya..."" so she took it home, called my SO, and doesn't know what to do with it.

I've never had someone not like it, and the normal response is total surprise that a meat-centric dish made vegetarian is actually good! (True culinary success can be measured by the number of trips for seconds and the amount of leftovers...)

I grew up with the meat version of this dish and it was one of the few meat-based recipes that I really missed when I became a vegetarian. After some experimentation, I came up with the following recipe:

**Vegetarian Kartoffelgratin**

.

2 cups	Lentils

4 cups	water

1/4 cup	Soy Sauce

Garlic

.

1 cup	Bulgur Wheat

.

1	Yellow Onion - chopped

Garlic

2 Leeks - sliced (with white) and thoughly rinsed

1 large Can of whole tomatos - chopped

3 Tbsp	Chopped fresh basil

.

4-6	Potatos, sliced

Peanut Oil sufficient for frying

Garlic

.

1/4 cup	Butter

1/4 cup Flour

1-2 cup	Milk

1/2+cup	Real Parmesan Cheese

.

- Combine the rinsed Lentils with the water, soy sauce, and garlic and cook until done.

- Meanwhile, soak the bulgur wheat in a sufficient amount of boiling water until it becomes ""chewy""

- Drain both the bulgur wheat and the Lentils and gently mix together

- Fry the garlic and onion in the oil until the onion is about half-way ""done""

- Add the Lentil-wheat mixture and gently fry, adding additional peanut or olive oil as neccessary
(the more the better!)

- Fry for about 5-10 minuites and add the Leeks, tomatos, and basil

- Fry, stiring gently until the leeks are ""mostly"" cooked

- Gently spread this mixture into the bottom of a LARGE baking dish

- Fry the potatos in a single layer with the garlic and cover the lentil-wheat mixture the fried potatos

- Meanwhile, melt the butter in a small saucepan and add the wheat, working it into a smooth mixture

- Add the Cheese, stiring constantly, and begin adding the milk 1/4 cup at a time; working in each portion until it is hot

- pour the cheese sauce over the potatos

- bake, covered for 20 min at 400dF (220dC); uncover and bake for an additional 10 minuites




I know, the soy sauce may sound weird, but in small amounts, and when cooked, it brings a savory non-soy-sauce flavor to the dish. Don't skip it. It's really quite essential. Also, I did not mark how much garlic to put in. It works pretty well with any amount of garlic as long as you don't go overboard. This dish is good with a light red wine.

130443,"I'm an addict. Nothing hard or too dangerous, it's just an addiction to pot.The trouble is that the level in which I like pot is too high. I have trouble controlling my urge to smoke. I know that it's not too detrimental to my life or my health but it is to my work ethic and emotional stability. I'm kindof a mess right now so I'm going to be all over the place but I see two main issues with my marijuana addiction, that is, two things that I dislike about it. 

The first is what I've already mentioned. I'm almost disgusted by the level at which I enjoy smoking pot. Today I reached the bottom of my bag and my entire town is dry for the first time in a very long time. Today I tried to take it slow, smoked one bowl in the morning (as opposed to my usual two or three) and went out, tried to get my mind off the near-empty bag. I went and processed some paperwork and procured some other intoxicants (alcohol). I managed to spend the day out of the house without acting on the urge to roll a spliff or hit a bowl, and the urge was strong as usual. You might ask, as I sometimes do, `why is it so important that you make your stash last or that you get more right away? You know you'll get some sooner or later` And I don't really know the answer. It must be the addiction, I think. The sense of security I get when I know there will be some more to smoke later, to go to that special place. 
- Anyway, I made it home and I start drinking to see if that will curb my desire to smoke pot, it didn't. I saw something on television and all of a sudden became very depressed and my mood wasn't improving by the lingering fact that I won't be able to get more pot anytime soon. From there my emotional state took a nose dive.
I hope that mess of a rant gives you an idea of my first disdain for my marijuana addiction, the level of addiction itself and how it effects me.

My second beef with pot is that I'm incapable of controlling my use. If I spent just a little time getting my days in order, scheduling myself and taking account of the way I spend my time then perhaps I would be more responsible with my usage and it wouldn't be as important to me that I got high anymore. 

Right now I'm afraid. I'm afraid because I just smoked up and all my depressive thoughts, anxieties and worries went down the drain. It's not that I don't care, it's that the problems seem to dissolve around me. I have a bit more left, one, maybe two bowls. I'm afraid I won't be able to handle when this stuff runs out. Some advice would be nice.

tl:dr - I'm addicted to pot, can't control my addiction and have almost run out of stuff. Afraid I'm going to crash, it gets pretty bad when I don't have any.",-1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

131046,"Here's what I would have liked to have seen happen.

First of all, I would have liked Dexter, Chase/Lumen, and Deb to have gotten to the camp in a more interesting way. Chase's ""trap"", which basically consisted of Dexter having poor reactive driving skills, was retarded. It's his own turf, he should have been laying in wait the second Dexter opened one of the doors and ambushed him there. Secondly, Deb finding the place based on an immigrant selling fruit who had a chance encounter with Jordan telling her that the only thing down that direction was a camp? Retarded. They could have had her call up the same guy Dexter did, have him say he already told Dexter the information, leaving Deb wondering why the hell Dexter would want to know.

This would then cause her to race to the camp, where Dexter has already outsmarted Chase, freed Lumen and let her kill him. Dex and Lumen have an emotional moment, and then Dexter tells her they better start cleaning up. Meanwhile, Deb is arriving at the camp. She is on edge as she silently comes down the steps, finger on the trigger. Lumen suddenly walks around a corner, and Deb accidentally shoots her. Realizing what she's done, she drops her gun and begins freaking out. Dex, who is off in another room stuffing Jordan's arm into a bag, comes running around, clutching his knife. Deb sees her brother there, covered in blood, and Dex sees his sister standing over Lumen's body, and we see both of their faces for a split second before it cuts to black. 

Come back from commercial, and we see Batista in the interrogating room with Quinn, pointing out all the evidence against him. He then tries to sympathize, telling him he doesn't believe he did it, but he needs to know who Liddy was spying on, asking for anything to go on. We see Quinn struggle with whether or not to answer.

Come back to the scene with Deb and Dexter, and we see both of them unravel simultaneously. Deb scrambles for her gun, pointing it at Dexter as she breaks down crying, saying ""What the fuck Dex?"" over and over again and then demanding an explanation. Dexter just stares at her, holding the knife, unable to process what has happened. Eventually, he snaps out of it and realizes he has to take charge of the situation. He overpowers Deb, gets her gun, and knocks her out. The season then ends with him looking at the carnage around him, with his internal monologue saying something about how he knew it would eventually come to this. Harry stands over Deb's body, looking at Dexter with disgust and disappointment in his eyes.

This would make for an incredibly interesting start for Season 6: Dex has to get rid of Chase and Lumen's bodies, keep Deb as a prisoner until he knows he can trust her to keep quiet, and then Quinn is sitting in a jail cell with information linking Dex to Liddy's murder. Would make for a great final season in which we watch Dexter slowly become more and more unhinged.

Unfortunately, I couldn't get proper funding to start the company.  It's dead in the water.  Thus, I need to think of my next step.  My options will relate to if I should stay in the new city, or move back and the options related with both.

Before this I was just a waiter, but I enjoyed the work because you meet great people and I'm a foodie.  The money is also decent.  So I could find the same work in either city.  

I also left a girlfriend I still care for in the first city.  We connected very well.  The thing is, I don't see myself marrying her.  There were a few things that she said which I disagree with or saw as signs of weakness that I don't want in my lifetime partner.  But, I know we still go together really well and if we were to get back together it will be a really fun relationship.  

I don't like the second city as much as the first.  The second city is dirtier and lacking in a good city feel or character.  I also don't have a car and getting around the second city is a real PITA.  The first city was much better.  

Friends - I left some amazing friends in the first city.  I also grew up outside of the second city and have plenty of friends in the area.  I'm realizing now that they're not the type of people I care to spend every night with.  They haven't grown up much.  I miss my friends in the first city, but I also feel that I could find some great friends in the second city once I find another job.  That's just how life is.  Also, the friends in the first city were kind of bad influences, but that is most certainly a restaurant industry thing.  A lot of people are alcoholics and not doing much with their lives.  I don't mind being a waiter, but I'd like to become a silent partner to open a restaurant or something like that.  So is the point of friends really a deal breaker?

So what do I do?  Do I go back to the first city or stick it out in the second city?  Regardless of where I am I could try another attempt at opening my business.  It's an idea that works anywhere.  If I move back to the first city do I get back together with my ex?

I've been attempting to dive into the world of electronics after programming for about 10 years and I keep getting ideas for little projects, but never have the knowledge to actually implement them. One such project is a glove that I can wear while sleeping to log GSR (galvanic skin response) and hopefully use the data to identify sleep patterns for other experiments. From what I've read, a GSR measurement circuit is super simple, but I'm just not grasping it. I know it measures resistance between the index and middle fingers, but how it actually does that, or how I can actually log that value with an AVR chip, I have no idea.

Can anyone recommend a simple, but relatively precise GSR circuit and explain each part of it? I realize that's probably a lot to ask, but I think if I can just get a clear explanation, I should be good to go. Most guides I've seen automatically assume I know what I'm doing, which I don't.

131630,"It's 6 in the morning and I'm going to college in a few hours, haven't been to sleep all night, I absolutley despise college, I hate it, I hate the work we do, I hate the course I'm on, I hate the teachers, the people on the course are bearable and the only reason I go is so that I can pretend to everyone that I'm actually doing something with my life, when the truth is I have absolutley no idea what I want to do, wait, I know what I want to do, the only thing that truly gives me joy when I think about it, is suicide, I mean why shouldn't I just get up and kill myself? I think the only reason I'm not doing it right now is because I couldn't do that to my family, but I'm almost past the point of caring about them anymore.

All I do is play games, I hate doing college work so much, I'm so far behind on all my work because I FUCKING HATE IT. When I'm at college all I do is browse reddit, I pretend to everyone that I'm going to attend university when I finish my course, but I know I'm not, all I want to do is play video games, it's my addiction I guess, some people are addicted to heroin, some to meth, but me, it's video games, but I love to play video games, I don't want to do anything else. I've never had a girlfriend which really cuts into me when I'm lying, alone and cold in bed at night, more and more lately I've been crying myself to sleep, and on top of that I'm gaining weight at a pretty steady weight, which just makes me more fucking angry and depressed with myself. I'm a fucking mess basically, who can't and doesn't want to do anything with his life but die. I put on a pretty normal existence to everyone however, I lie constantly about things I haven't done or am not going to do just so I don't look like that fat anti-social loser who does nothing and has no friends, let me tell you something else too...

I fucking hate the world, we live in a shithole, our planet is an awful awful place and I want to leave it, I honestly don't want to live to see what we become in the future, we will leave an even worse planet for our children and grandchildren to live on, and no one even cares, I don't even care really, It's just something that eats away at me and I've come to accept as fact, even though I'm sure some people live very happy lives, not me though, nothing but sadness.

I guess, growing up, my life went from one extreme to another, sometimes life would be great, but my dad was an alcoholic, I mean he smoked weed too, but it was just to help him sleep, hell I'm kinda glad he smoked weed, It was a lot better than when he was drunk, fuck, he'd always stay out overnight and there would be weekends where I wouldn't even see him, I always thought I'd never see him again, him and my mum always argued, he sometimes hit my mum, but only when drunk. He cheated on her twice, my mum took him back after the 1st time, and for the first couple of years or so it was great, but things quickly when tits up and he was back to old ways, and he knows he fucked up massively with my mum, and he regrets all the things he did, but you know, I'll always love my dad but I'll always associate those bad times with him, and it pains me so much to think of him that way, and I'm slowly starting to hate my mum, because all she ever does is say bad, horrible things about him infront of me and my brothers faces, I fucking hate it. My dad never says a single thing bad about her either, it's just out of spite when she says the stuff she does, and I hate it. I'd say it's fucked me up somewhat mentally, but I don't know, in my mind I know I'm messed up, but there's no way in hell I can convey my mental state in text.

I've probably missed some stuff that I'd like to have putten down for all you anonymous people that I have never met to have read, but I guess that's for another time, I don't know what has come over me, I wouldn't usually do anything like this, I guess I had an epiphany of sorts, if I don't get help soon then I don't know what's gonna happen. Please don't suggest for me to go and talk to someone, I don't have anyone to talk to, why do you think I'm posting on here for help? This is my last chance, I may get round to a tl;dr version but for now, I'm going to go and attempt to get a couple hours of sleep before I have to go and waste another day of my life doing something I don't want to do.

And I'm not talking ""oh look, there's a cloud that vaguely resembles Homer Simpson"". I'm talking ""holy shit that *is* Homer Simpson"". Sometimes, I could even see it in colour. I also found that, as the clouds moved, the images would change slightly, and my brain would basically animate them. At one point I saw a helicopter hovering in the sky, rotors spinning and everything as it swayed back and forth.

Most amazing of all, however, was that my brain would generally not ""see"" patterns that were outwardly familiar, insofar as I see them on a regular basis, but rather create whole new concepts that my conscious mind was not aware of ever seeing before, like a snake using its mouth to remove a Greek theatre mask from the face of Zeus.

In closing, I found this to be the most incredible experience I have ever had while high. I recommend it to all of you.

***Main Abilities***

4 Bosses with 3 Abilities

**1. Toxitron**

**a.  Poison cloud**:  Green aoe on floor.  Don't stand in it.  But if you can kite Constucts into it, it will damage them as well as us.

**b.  Poison Soaked Shell**:  Stacking dot applied to any that hit him (i think only melee) increases your damage.  Take a couple stacks, but stop attacking at 3(maybe?).

**c.  Poison Protocol**:  Three Putricide slimes will target anyone except MT.  Must be burnt fast and must not touch their target.  If they do they blow up for ~100k damage to target and leave a puddle of bad on the floor.



**2.  Electron**

**a. Lightning Conductor**:  Random raid member becomes charged and must get away from raid.  They take no damage from this but the cause aoe damage to anyone near by.

**b.  Electrical Discharge**:  Herp Derp Chain Lightning.  Up to 3 members can be hit if within 8 yards of each other.

**c.  Unstable Shield**:  10 sec shield that deals damage to raid if attacked.  So don't.



**3.  Magmatron**

**a. Incineration Security Measure(ISM)**:  Big ass flame jets spray outwards in 360degrees.  Unavoidable, must have heals.  (Bubble is probably awesome for this)

**b.  Acquiring Target**:  High damage to one person.  A beam will show between him and them.  They must move to a position where no one is between him and them.  Raid awareness folks.  Don't be in the middle of beam before fire blast comes out.

**c.  Barrier**:  Stop attacking the boss because if you break this shield 70k damage is dealt to erryone.



**4.  Arcanotron**

**a.  Power Generator**:  Pretty puddle on the ground that **healers and dps SHOULD stand in**.  Nice buff to deeps and mana regen.  Keep boss out of here.

**b.  Arcane Annihilator**:  100k damage to random single target.  Must be interrupted.

**c.  Power Conversion**:  Huge stacking buff to bosses dps.  Must be spellstealed or purged.




***Procedure***

We will never be fighting more than two of these guys at a time.  In fact after the first golem starts we will fight two the whole time.  The bosses are on an energy timer.  This timer will tick down and start 1 of 5 things.

**First pull: 100%  Golem 1**

First golem becomes active and is targetable and dps'able.  Heed abilities and burn as best you can.  Main tank pick up this boss.  

**50% Golem 1 / 100% Golem 2**  

At 50% energy on the first golem, a second golem will become active and dpsable.  OT pick this'un up.

**45% Golem 1 / 95% Golem 2**

5% energy later the first golem will use its shield ability so dps should switch to number two (unless number one has an interruptable/stealable ability - in this case keep the capable dps member on #1, not dpsing but ready for int/steal).  

**25% Golem 1 / 75% Golem 2**

20% energy later the first golem's shield will fall off.  

**0% Golem 1 / 50% Golem 2 / 100% Golem 3**  

25% energy later the first golem will be at 0% and become inactive, and the third golem will come up.  Prepare for shield ability on Golem we are dpsing.  MT get G3.

**45% Golem 2 / 95% Golem 3**

5% later #2 pops shield.

Rinse and Repeat.

4 bosses share a mana pool.  

Seems chaotic at first glance, but we once thought BP was hectic.  

***Strategy***

While Toxitron is up:

Stay spread out.  Don't stand in Green stuff.  Burn the shit out of slimes.  Maybe kite boss into poison cloud.  Get a few stacks of soaked shell to increase dps.

While Magmatron is up:

Big heals during ISM.  Stay out of laser beam.  Don't attack during shield.

While Arcanotron is up:

Stand in buff pool.  Interupt Annihilator.  Spellsteal buff.

While Electrion is up:  

Run away if you get Conductor.  Spread for Chain Lightning.  Don't attack during shield.

It felt as if my head were expanding in a loosely circular shape (though I'd describe it as more amorphous) in the upward/forward direction from my forehead. After the expansion reached a point where it felt like my head took up a good 5-foot area, there was a very subtle vibration throughout my forehead, extending into the rest of my head (including the amorphous extension.) The vibration and the giant-head-sensation continued until the end of my meditation session. Both were *extremely* pleasant.

My good friend Biggie's softball team came in 2^nd this season. The playoffs and finals were on the same day and he was exhausted by the final game.

This seems to have been the final straw for him. After years of us trying to motivate him to do something about weight he has now vowed to lose 50lbs before the next season starts (8months). For that I am grateful.

However I don't want to see him get hurt or burn out before he reaches his goal. Any advice on how I can best help him would be appreciated. He seems to have a Rocky sorta thing in mind but I know that can end very badly. Thanks in advance:

Mods are your own call, but I'd say that **BetterLight** is practically essential. It makes everything look amazing.

There's a gigantic and thorough list at: http://www.minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?f=25&amp;t=81195 and another decent one at http://www.minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?f=25&amp;t=12352. They don't have everything I do, and I don't have everything they do.

I'm not going to copy it all here, because there's no point (as you can just go there and click instead of here), and the list I've made is based mostly on texture packs created by the reddit community, or ones at least that have done well here and are well-liked/popular. For the really detailed list, hit the links above. I'll still maintain this one as best I can with texture packs that are created and/or do well here.

By reddit, for reddit!

Also, no plagiarism this way.

135337,"""Exercise is the same thing as getting a tan — a stress imposed on the body that it can adapt to, but only if the stress is designed properly. Lots and lots of people come in to the gym and bench 225 every Monday and Friday for years, never even attempting to increase the weight, sets, reps, speed, or pace between sets. Some don't care, but some are genuinely puzzled that their bench doesn't go up, even though they have not asked it to. Your bench strength doesn't adapt to the total number of times you've been to the gym to bench, or your sincerest hope that it will get stronger. It adapts to the stress imposed on it by the work done with the barbell. Furthermore, it adapts to *exactly* the kind of stress imposed on it. If you do sets of 20, you get good at doing 20's. If you do heavy singles, you get better at doing those. But singles and 20's are very different, and 
you don't get better at doing one by practicing the other. The muscles and nervous system function differently when they do these two things, and they require two different sets of skills and abilities, and thus cause the body to adapt differently. The adaptation occurs in response to the stress, and *specifically* to that stress, because the stress is what causes the adaptation. This is why calluses form on the hand where the bar rubs, and not on the other parts of the hand, or on the face, or all over your body.

This seems to have been the final straw for him. After years of us trying to motivate him to do something about weight he has now vowed to lose 50lbs before the next season starts (8months). For that I am grateful.

However I don't want to see him get hurt or burn out before he reaches his goal. Any advice on how I can best help him would be appreciated. He seems to have a Rocky sorta thing in mind but I know that can end very badly. Thanks in advance:

&gt;Everyone in the UK is entitled to a ""presumption of bail"", which means they have the right to remain at liberty unless or until they have been convicted by a court. But prosecutors can deny that presumption if they show a defendant is at risk of absconding. Assange's lawyers and supporters were able to offer the judge sufficient conditions to overcome those fears. If he is freed after the appeal, his supporters will have had to have provided a security of *£200,000* – which would be forfeited if he absconds – and two sureties, each of *£20,000*. **[ergo, a total of GBP 240,000.]**

Now, I'm not saying we have to get all of it together, or that I've got a website up and running ready to accept 240,000 pounds (or equivalent) of your hard earned money - I'm not - But surely there is somewhere out there on the great big webernet where there's a reputable person who's a supporter of him that's got a donation page up for him? And if there is, I ask you, maybe we could get behind it?

I, for one, feel I could do a bit for fighting for freedom of speech if I could a donate some money to a worthy cause like that.

Sorry if this all seem a bit fragmented or not well thought out, I just thought of it 15 minutes ago and so this post might not be worded perfectly :)

So, as the title suggests, My parents asked me to help my mom improve her english while I'm home for the holiday break. Since it was on very short notice that they asked me to do this, I don't have a lot of time to prepare lessons or anything because they want me to start right away (and I'm going home tomorrow). I am a fluent speaker of english and I personally have studied/learned 5 different languages, but I am just not too sure on the best method of teaching it. 

A bit of background: We are from Brazil, and have lived here for about 15 years. I came here at a young age so I picked up on english quite easily. For my parents who were already older and have a harder time learning a new language it wasn't quite as easy. My dad picked up on it slightly better than my mom, so he is ok. 

My mom does already speak english, but it's far from fluent. The main areas they asked me to focus on are: English grammar, conversation, and accent correction (She has a very thick portuguese accent).

Are there any good reccomended websites or books that I should use? How can I test exactly what level my mom is at so I know where to begin teaching and what areas to focus on?

Before leaving work, I did what I always do on a bar night, spiked up my now about 8 inch mohawk and hopped on the bus to head downtown. 

Upon walking into the bar, the bartender didn't allow me to purchase a single drink {I was not sober, nor was I stumbling around like a fool} before gesturing at my hair. Confused, I asked for a Keith's. She then sent a high school friend of mine, one of the bus girls there, to where the bouncer was standing.

Basically, if my computer is on for a long time and/or idle, it seems like it loses its connection to the internet (even though it is still connected to my wifi network).

Things I've tried so far:

1. Assigning devices to a specific DHCP address to avoid devices fighting over the same one. (alternatively, just leaving DHCP to auto on everything).

2. Ensuring that my wifi is broadcasting on the least busy channel (there are a lot of wifi networks on channel 11 in my apartment complex)

Okay so I've been dating my girlfriend for about 2 1/2 years and we've been ""physical"" for almost 3.

Not to say that our sex lives are boring (quite the contrary!) but I've noticed we pretty much have a routine:

One of us will finger the other, eventual penetration with 2 fingers occurs. Oral sex ensues, where the receiver is laying on her back, legs spread, and the giver goes between the legs. From what I understand this is pretty standard for oral sex.

We usually switch off from there and the receiver becomes the giver, etc. Rinse, repeat.

I recently purchased a vibrator and we've only used it twice. My girlfriend isn't too sure she likes it (but she did get incredibly wet from it last time we used it!). It's a rabbit-type vibrator, and I used it mainly for penetration because the vibrating on her clit didn't seem to do much for her. Same goes for me, though I'm pretty sure I enjoyed the penetration from it :) It was just an odd sensation...we both decided it felt like it was making us feel like we had to poop almost. Weird!

Anywho, I've been trying to spice it up a little and I asked her to give me one new idea for us to try the next time we have sex. She read a bit and watched some videos of different positions but she couldn't get into them (she said they looked kinda awkward and if the position went wrong -ie, we started cracking up because of how silly it is- it may end up ruining the mood).

Sooo... I just thought I'd ask. What do you guys suggest? What's your favorite (girlxgirl) positions? We're not looking for anything too crazy, so I'd say keep it fairly vanilla, but I'd like to see any suggestions you may have. :)

PS: I'm super low on money right now so I'm unsure if I'd be able to purchase another toy to help our sex adventures along :(

PPS: This doesn't really have to even be ""positions"" per se, but anything that might spice up our sex lives :)

So does anyone want to commit to 30 days of meditation starting January 2nd (to be compassionate to those of us who might be hungover January 1st)? As little or as much practice a day as you want.

**edit:**

Since there's a bit of an interest I think it's a go.  Everyone should think about how much time a day they'd like to commit.  For beginners, committing 5 minutes is probably way better than committing an hour -- it's more important to do it every day than it is to just do one long session and get burnt out, or to commit to an amount of time you simply don't have or aren't ready for.  Also, just because you only commit a low number (5 minutes) doesn't mean you can't practice more if you want.

Also, if you miss a day, it's more important to start back up the next then just quit the whole thing.  Starting back up after missing a day is probably another more important thing for a beginner (because you're going to miss a day) than it is to strictly practice every day.

I've never really had issues talking to or being comfortable around women from my culture and have good female friends as well, but I haven't managed to trust anyone enough to go beyond that point. The few times that I've felt any feelings of attraction beyond basic friendship have been accompanied by unpleasant(to say the least) flashbacks of the past.

141082,"Today I got a phone call: ""your sister is in the hospital with a broken limb"". As the stranger told me: she left her home, got on a motorized vehicle and the throttle got stuck and now she's screaming in pain in the ER.

Back Story: my sister is a liar, cheat and reliably unreliable. She's the kind of person that will say she'll be there then text for hours during your big moment saying ""got lost"" or ""had to give someone keys"" or ""fell asleep"" all the while giving you the impression she'll show up but never does. It's always lies. I think she actually believes her excuses.

She'll also come over and give you a sob story about how she has no money and needs to use your computer to ""find a job"". You say ok, sure. Use it but I need to get back to work, How does an hour sound?

Cut to 2 hours later and I'm explaining how I set a clear boundary and she needs to give up the goods because I work from home and need to get back to work. This all the while I'm feeding her and giving her things to sell at the local consignment store.

She's been a heroin addict for a few years now. But beyond the heroin she's just your normal trouble maker. Constantly stealing and justifying it because she has no money. To her the world owes her everything. She's a practiced scam artist. Has developed a fake name to go with the fake social security number. This is used with cops and for medical attention.

Over the past year and a half I've kinda cut her off. 

Every reach out I get is over text and in some attempt to help her.

I've moved into the mindset that I do not want to meet her where I am in any but a position of a peer. 

I'm simply broken. I don't want to get hurt anymore. I feel terrible guilt, shame and regret that we don't have a relationship where I can show up to make my little sis laugh in her time of need.

But I can not do it anymore.

I don't want her drama.

I've done my work. I've shaken a lot of the shackles from chaotic family of origin. Got my obsessions, compulsions and addictions under reasonable control.

After getting this phone call today all I could do was imagine the worst. I'd show up to the ghetto hospital. Not be able to find or get in touch with her because as usual she's unreliable.

Let's say I did. Then what?

She's perpetually homeless. She'll want to stay in my tiny apartment I share with my comes-from-a-healthy-family partner. I would never do that to my better half. This is our home and it must be a calm and safe place. After growing up like we did and refuse to live with the same chaos and drama if even for a second.

Ya see, if my sister had the ability to respect the boundaries for others then it would be different. But she is still so incredibly resentful with me and it comes out with every interaction.

I think she looked up to me way to much for my age. In her mind I let her down. 

I'm rambling here aren't I?

here's what I would like. 

Help me find the correct and healthy mind space to deal with her.

I know the hardest part is that I want to change her. I know this is a big part of 12 step/co-dependent work. You must accept that you can't.

But even if I can't. How do I have even the smallest relationship with someone so resentful, so self-centered and so far away from what is actually happening?

and what I mean is she did this to herself. Her carelessness is a part of her disease. She is actively trying to hurt herself.

I made it clear 3 years ago. If you end up in jail, I will not bail you out.

However, the images are low-res and quite frankly do not look all that great (decent, but not great). I looked around to find a better one, but could not.  
So I decided that I would use [Astronomy Picture of the Day](http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/), especially because they have an [RSS feed](http://apod.nasa.gov/apod.rss) that I should be able to conveniently substitute in line 6 of the bing theme. Except that doesn't work, the background stays black.  
I tried a couple other APOD RSS feeds, none worked. I also tried modding the original aero theme with no luck.  
**TL;DR**: Could somebody perhaps modify the bing theme to use APOD (and also explain how dynamic wallpapers and RSS feeds work)?

10x10 grid...2 paddles, one on each side that are 3 pixels high each, and a 1 pixel 'ball'


This would give each paddle a vertical movement range of 8 pixels, since the system would only need to track the position of the middle pixel in each paddle, meaning that their movement and location can be controlled by a 3-bit counter capable of counting up or down.  The 'controller' would be a 2 push-button system per player.


The 'ball' would be able to travel on the middle part of the screen which would be 8x10...The location of the ball would be tracked by 2 separate counters on a shared clock, 3-bit for the X and 4-bit for the Y, each pixel on the field would then be activated by a separate 2-input AND gate...a separate bit for both X and Y would be needed to indicate direction, forcing the counter to count up or down and then reverse when it reaches the boundaries of the top and bottom of the screen, or when it hits a pixel containing a paddle.


Collision detection would be achieved by a gate that would interrupt the clock when the 'ball' has reached the max or min range on the X and there is no input for the 'paddle' pixels at that position on the Y...


The scored point would then be determined by the X direction state of the ball when the clock is interrupted.  Each player's score would be indicated by torches, and after the match point is scored it will trip flashing torches for that player and lock the game.


A 'round reset' would be needed to reposition the ball after a point is scored, the 'serve' would automatically move in direction of the player who was scored on as the direction bits would not have changed.


A 'master reset' would be required after one player has scored the match point.  The master reset would reset the paddle locations, player scores, and ball position.


Obviously, this will be a very easy game, due to the slow movement of the 'ball', possibly made at least a little challenging by the delay of the controls.  The ball will also move in a constant diagonal direction, making it very predictable...One player mode is easy, by forcing all the 'paddle' pixels on one side to stay on so it will in effect bounce off a wall...

So far I've found out I hold my face all staunch when I'm playing Minecraft, I think It's a sub-conscious psychological attack on the enemies, if they wern't so averse to conspiring and charging in in waves[sometimes it looks like they're just acting in self-defense], I'd die.

		mkdir $dir

	else
		NUMBER=$((`ls -v1 $dir | tail -1 | egrep -Eo [0-9]+` + 1));

So I started to have different kinds of activities every Wednesdays (I have only had two so far). Last time I had Taco night, and the week before that it was an after work (and involved alcohol).

Age range is 22-34 (none of us have kids), all of us enjoy drinking and playing computer games, and all of us are a bit lazy, don´t do sports (think geeks), and I hate ball and card games (bowling, pool, soccer, poker etc).

The notion that we are aiming to destroy capitalism completely will cut us off from success, and I feel that it is too extreme of a view. I feel that this will be the topic to kill the movement. What is needed is a mixed economy with controlled capitalism with socialism. I feel that the two work best when combined with each other. 

(edit)- a few of you are advocating going into a completely socialist economy. The reason i posted this is that fact that I feel people should have the choice and right to start their own businesses, and that socialism isn't a perfect form of governing. To go fully socialist would rely on public cooperation and understanding, and is based entirely on the working class. I don't fear people having money or being able to make more money then others, I am more concerned with human rights and economic stability.

144880,"Have some time today before work today so I decided to write this.  I'm using a throwaway since I don't want to look like some jerk off who's bragging about the rare occasions he's hit a homer run.

One thing I frequently reflect on is times I've been ""in the zone,"" and had incredible success with women.  These times have been rare, but they have happened.  One thing I quickly realized was that with these girls I didn't engage in long drawn out conversations.  There's three times in particular I always think of when trying to recapture that feeling:  

1.) Met these 2 girls downstairs at a party.  I very quickly got them both back up to my room.  Within 20 minutes I had met them, gotten them up to my room, hooked up with both of them.  The one I spent the rest of the night hooking up with, the other I would hook up with a week or two later in a sexual experience I still masturbate to.  (I'll come back to this night later on).

2.) Met girl at friends house.  Within 5 minutes we were heading back to my house to have sex.  We'd have sex a few more times after that.

3.) Met girl at New Years party.  Her friend was crying about having lost her purse.  I said something along the lines that her friend needs to stop fake crying for sympathy and attention.  Immediately started hooking up with her in hallway, and had sex with her that night.           

I don't remember what I said to any of them, but I remember how I felt.  Everything just came together.  I was sexual towards them in a way that was apparent and unapologetic.  I certainly didn't use any lines or techniques.  I made what I wanted pretty clear.

Then I think of times I tried to present myself as being a brilliant, comfortable in his own skin, conversationalist.  I usually could hold a girls attention for quite awhile as she talks about whatever and I relate.  I made sure to ""DHV,"" as much as possible.  I make her laugh and we have a grand ole time.  In the end though, I can't think of one time I even so much as got more than a number off a ""great"" conversation.  Often this baffled me, since in the beginning I was convinced this girl was nuts for me.                

I then thought back to that night with the 2 girls I talked about earlier.  After I had hooked up with them for awhile, we needed more drinks.  Long story short I invited one of my friends in to come hang while we drank (for the record, I wasn't trying to help him out or anything like that).  He had no idea what had happened prior to his entering the room.  He almost certainly took an interest in the one girl and began talking to her:

""So where do you live this year?""

""What's your major?""

""How's that going?""

""Do you know X?""  

She was polite, and responded to all his questions.  Outwardly, it seemed they were having a decent conversation.  But her attitude and demeanor towards him was completely different than it was towards me.  It wasn't sexual in the least.  I've seen this countless other times, and see it constantly in bars.  

The only reason I bring this up is because in almost every post to new guys I see someone say, ""Talk to everyone!"".  In all honesty, I think this is a great way to develop bad habits.  Its going to teach you how to engage in boring conversations.

**BUT THAT'S WHY YOU NEED KINO BRO!!!** 

I don't care how much kino you use, if you're listening to her talk about backpacking through Europe you're probably spinning your wheels.  I'd also be willing to bet every time kino goes creepy, its because you're touching her while talking about the stock market.  
 
It gives rise to openers that no one gives a shit about, such as the ""what's your new years resolution?"" one which was introduced in another thread.  Unless you follow up with, ""my resolution is to put my penis in your mouth,"" you're going to be costing yourself more ass than you're getting. 

How many posts go up daily about guys who get ""friend-zoned""?  Chances are, if they hadn't tried to appear too cool for school, they'd have known where they stood the whole time.

I'm sure occasionally the long conversation approach works, but overall you're probably squandering situations.

145172,"So, about 4 or 5 months ago, I drove across the country to be with my (now) husband. I drove from Portland, Oregon to a little town in Illinois, just outside St. Louis. 

When I left Portland, it was hard. I love that city a ton, and I always felt attached to it unlike anywhere else I'd lived. (I moved around a lot as a kid. We finally settled in Portland in seventh grade.) But I was on the cusp of homelessness/joblessness, and the rent was too damn high. Still, I loved my city to death, and it was hard to leave it. 

So, when I finally realised that I wouldn't be able to survive there anymore, I packed my things into my tiny 1984 Volvo, and drove to Illinois over the course of three days. 


I'm now living in Illinois with my loving husband and I have a job that I actually really love. I'm living comfortably (for the most part) and I know that I did the right thing in moving here. But I still feel terribly homesick. 

I have no friends or family here, aside from my husband. I've tried making friends, but I don't really get along with a lot of the people here. Its hard to find female friends that have the same interests as I do, or that don't think I'm a total weirdo. (I read comics and own two rats. I might as well be an alien to the girls I've met.) 

And, what makes it worse, is that I see reminders of Portland all over reddit. I spend a lot of my time on reddit, if I'm not gaming, and I do love it. But it seems there are a lot of Portlanders that frequent this site. (The Portland subreddit has 2,000+ redditors. St. Louis just has a few hundred.) But every time I see someone mentioning that they are from portland, its like a smack to the face, and I have to exit the page to try and forget about it, because it hurts *that* bad, remembering all my friends, family, precious food carts, and uniqueness that I left behind in portland. 

My husband and I are saving up to visit portland, and we were supposed to make it during christmas. But, as you can see, that didn't work out. Its going to be very hard this year to spend the holidays without my family. I'll likely be working. (My husband hates Christmas. So he's not big on celebrating it.)

On top of that, my cousin is getting married in Febuary, and we're trying desperatly to save up money to get there. I've been taking on overtime, and we've cut our eating habits back a bit, as well as other frivolities. However, there is a LOT of work my car needs done. (New tires, new alignment, new belts, breaks, ect...) And I'm worried that we'll have to spend the savings on my car, and miss my cousin's wedding. If thats the case, we won't be able to go until next fall, because in the spring and summer I'm taking classes at the community college, and during my break between spring/summer I'm visiting my dad whom I haven't seen in three years. 

Waiting that long to go home would kill me. I'm already starting to feel depressed and terribly homesick as it is. And its only been five months. 


This was more of a rant/ramble than anything else, but any encouraging words or suggestions you can share on the matter would be greatly appreciated. 

**TL;DR** Moved away from Portland, OR a few months ago to Illinois. Incredibly homesick, and don't know how to deal with it.

1. All explosives are always unstable.

3. Keep your finger off the detonator until you are prepared to detonate.  
4. Be sure of your target and the radius of the explosion.

145743,"I have had a taxing year to say the least. I quit my job in June because of back problems that the doctors had not been able to do anything about. At the time I was 7,000 dollars behind on my mortgage because my room-mate and fiance both moved out the previous november(over a year ago) leaving me to pay for a house on my income alone which I could barely afford things when we were all splitting things three ways.

 A family member loaned/gave me $5,000 to pay of my delinquent mortgage payments, but since I didn't have the full amount the mortgage company wouldn't take a partial payment because I was in foreclosure. I stopped that and have been trying to get a modification but in June I quit my job and decided my only shot was to use the money I was borrowed and start a company doing the profession I had been working in for 10 years. Things looked good at first until I landed a couple of big job and had to invest some capitol. What I was afraid of happening happened. Three accounts just decided not to pay(over 10,000 dollars of payments total) and even if I took them to court I wouldn't see the money until long after I am kicked out of my house. My family doesn't come around or call and I know they care but I just don't feel the emotional attachment to them I think a normal person would. 

This month my student loans will no longer be able to be deferred and that is basically going to seal the nail in the coffin for me. I can't even sell my house without losing money and have been a wreck about the whole thing for almost a year now. I am now to the point that I don't care about much anymore. I am on unemployment and am literally starving just so that I can keep the lights and heat on in my house. The only other thing I pay for is the internet because if I didn't have it I'd have nobody to talk to. I can barely even drive my car anywhere because my tags expired in july and I have no way to pay the $200 to get new ones. My insurance just got dropped to for failure to pay so there is also that. I just don't know what to even say to my family about how I can't even afford to pay for gas to come visit over Christmas let alone get my car street legal(which I don't even worry about anymore).

I'm just done. I want the relief of not feeling any of this anymore. I can't even sleep at night because of the horrible anxiety that my dreams cause me. I go to a psychiatrist but I don't think it is helping and it is the only one I can afford($50 every three months, I dont have insurance).

145919,"Okay, throwaway obviously, I'm 25, south Asian (Indian), 6 feet tall, 210 lbs (Muscular but I got some chubbiness) and I'm balding (pretty bad on the top, sides are okay, I keep a low haircut so it doesn't look to bad I guess). I'm in grad school, I don't have time to go party, I workout 5-7 days a week in the gym, where I see a lot of women and maybe have the best chance to meet one and talk to them there.

**Question 1 specifically for White women: what is your perception of South Asian men? Attractive, why? Not attractive, why not? What about perceptions taking into account 9/11 and all this terrorism stuff, does it really affect your view of us? **

I can totally understand if you hate south Asian men, when it comes to tech support lol, I hate them too!

**Question 2: Does it really matter if the guy you meet is chubby?**

As for me, I have muscular arms, chest, shoulders, but I have a small double chin and a belly w/love handles, but I swear I'll get rid of it by summer! :D I have to look good, part of my profession (looks matter in how people treat you unfortunately)

**Question 3: How do you gain a man's attention after hes made eye contact? (especially in the gym)**

I have a really hard time interpreting signals, I have no problem making eye contact and smiling, I just don't know the signals after, so I end up walking by. I have no female friends to help me out with this either. :(

I partly blame my culture and family for that, they purposely made sure I never had GFs and the one girl I did make friends with, they persecuted me until I stopped. It's my fault too because when I went to college, I never changed, but I don't want to be like this anymore!

**Question 4: What do you think of meeting guys at the gym?** 

My gym time is for me to focus and be alone (so I can understand that), but since there are soo many pretty girls in my gym I just can't help but not look! It doesn't help when the hot girl is doing yoga either :(

**Question 5: Is it really hard for very attactive girls find a decent guy?** 

I read another post on here about super attractive women having a really hard time because a) most men just wanna bang them and b) her friends secretly hate her for being hot. 

I'm a virgin, I don't really care about getting laid, if it happens so be it, but I'm looking to meet a girl that I can be happy with, I've been rejected my whole life so I tend to show zero emotion.

**Question 6: When women look at me, I assume the are judging me and probably thinking like: ""errr, let me get out of the way, this guy is weird/ugly"" I know that's harsh thinking, I'm sure many girls don't think that way, so what is your first reaction when you see a guy? What goes through your head?** 

I always smile when I make eye contact, so I figure if they avoid me, its because I'm not good looking, or people genuinely are just afraid of me?

Last point/question/rant, in my time in college there plenty of people who socialized into small groups, I've always been excluded from the Indian/desi ones, **I have no idea why?** And the one time i did make ""friends"", we all had a great time, talked, smoked hookah and stuff, and then they excluded me! I find out they are going out and having fun, but they never invited me :(

Female Indians I feel are the worst because everytime I saw one and said: ""Hi"" or just smiled, they would gaze through me like I don't exist. Y U NO LIEK ME?

I've been rejected by my own race forever, no male or female indian friends.

Of all the women that I've met, let alone had a chance with, this one is the one that I've been most interested in. If I fail here, I am going to go into a morbid fit of depression. Not really.

I have been doing well in giving it time before I message her so that when she hears from me, she is talkative and happy to hear from me. Her friends have told me that she tends to get bored with guys that she has dated, so I am trying to use that in my favor.

My fellow Redditors, where is the best place to take a woman like this on a first date? Her and I both like music, so I thought about a venue, but I think that will be too loud to have any conversation. Too much conversation on the other hand could be a recipe for disaster feeding an Appetite for Destruction. (Pun intended)

Keep In mind that I've never actually met this girl. I found her on Okcupid, became friends with her on Facebook and saw that we have mutual friends. We have been texting for a few days and have chatted a few times.

As a side note, I'd like to avoid coffee because it's constant, in your face conversation and it will make me nervous. When I'm nervous, I'm not myself at all. Walking makes me feel comfortable.


-TL;DR

Where is a good place to have a first date with someone that I've never met? I don't want to mess up a good opportunity.

147213,"Ok, first some background information: I'm 22 and engaged (I've been with my fiancé for three years) and my family and I are not on the best terms since I decided not to be a Christian three years ago. My mom has always been a very serious person, and while I can be a bit serious myself I think I take after my dad who is more fun-loving and lighthearted.

The main issue: We are getting married next summer, and since I am very introverted I'm not really into the whole wedding planning schtick. I am really into details and logistics and large formal gatherings like weddings already make me stressed. My mom is adding to this with the following:

* acting silently upset/unhappy if things aren't going the way she thinks they should,

* putting pressure on me to have a small inexpensive wedding even though my fiancé's family is large and they are paying for pretty much all of it (my mom is embarrassed by this and so wants to limit what my in-laws can contribute)

* reminding me of how stressful weddings are (and how stressful my sister's wedding was) 

* insisting that I really need to stick up for what I prefer in the details of the wedding, even though I don't care much and my mother-in-law does care (and she doesn't have any daughters so I might as well let her have fun with it).

However, my fiancé's family is way more easygoing and ""sure, let's make this work"" about everything. By being cheerful about it and not watching every stinking penny they have shown me it's actually possible to make wedding stuff fun. I want to adopt their philosophy and feel like that, too, but when I talk to my mom she is always a downer and reminds me how much money is being spent or how much work it would be to do something cheaply and basically makes me feel like not wanting to do it at all. I try to love my mom and I want to include her, but when I find myself parroting her ""but that's too expensive"" or ""that would be really hard to do"" to my in-laws, I start to resent the influence she has on me.

On the one hand, I'm not entirely unsympathetic to the attitude behind the argument, but on the other, certain elements of the article really pissed me off. This paragraph, for instance:

&gt;Since its inception in 1996, the Book Club has carved its niche among readers by telling them that the novel is a chance to learn more about themselves. It’s not about literature or writing; it’s about looking into a mirror and deciding what type of person you are, and how you can be better. While a generally wrongheaded view of novels, this notion is all the more frustrating when the club delves into the true classics, with their vast knottiness, glorious language, breathtaking characters, and multi-faceted, mind-twisting prose. None of that matters in Oprah’s view of books, since reading is yet another exercise in self-gratification. “If you have read him, what do you think Dickens might have to share and teach those of us who live in this digital age?” the Book Club’s producer, Jill, asks on Oprah’s website. This is the Eat, Pray, Love school of reading. 

It seems to me that Kelly is here profoundly ignorant of modern literary criticism's roots in the liberal humanism of the late 19th century, which asked *precisely* these types of questions, and furthermore there is a distinct tone of condescension and elitism throughout that I think is entirely counterproductive to getting people back on board with reading the classics.

Which Oprah is doing. Sure, maybe not everybody's going to *get* it right off the bat, but maybe somebody will who wouldn't otherwise have ever read Dickens, and are we really going to denigrate anything or anyone who facilitates that?

However, consider this: Person of the Year hasn't meant anything for years now. Originally, as I'm sure you all know, Man (later Person) of the Year was given to whoever was the biggest newsmaker in that year. In 1938, Adolf Hitler was undoubtedly the biggest newsmaker, therefore he was Man of the Year for 1938. The following year, it was Josef Stalin, the second time the Man of Steel got that title. So it obviously wasn't a necessarily positive thing. By this logic, Assange should have gotten it.

That changed in 2001. The biggest story of that year was undoubtedly the 9/11 attacks. The biggest newsmaker, one would think, would be Osama bin Laden, and thus he would be named Man of the Year. However, this was not the case, as the title went to Rudy Giuliani (a sense of ""patriotism"" and plain sensitivity about these things may have had a hand in the decision, I think). With that, Person of the Year became a positive thing, another award, which led to such idiotic winners as ""You"" in 2006.

Mainly because hot girls are usually high maintenance, and I am very unaccommodating if I feel someone is more than capable of doing things themselves.  I also expect to get less in return from going out of my way to help a hot looking girl, mainly because I feel they will appreciate it less because they are expecting better treatment to begin with.

About three years ago my family got a cat because we felt that our older cat needed a play mate. They are both females and didn't really get along. It wasn't less than a year after when our younger cat started to act very strange. She became addicted to food, nothing was more important to her no matter who was petting her or what all she wanted was food. She was fighting our other cat for food until we fed them both in separate rooms and she gained an abnormal amount of weight. She became a complete un-wanted member of my house to my parents and my older sister because she would never want to get pet and attacked my older cat whenever she got the chance.

Recently for the past 4 or so months she has been defecating all over our house like she is not housebroken. We did not have this problem before and she used the litter box all the time. We have brought her to the vet multiple times and tried all kinds of diet food but she has not stopped defecating all over our house. My parents have threatened to put her down but I have been trying to think of what I can do. Right now I have her kept in one room with a litterbox, food and I play with her all the time and I'm trying to get her house broken but nothing has seemed to work.

So please r/pets what can I do? I don't want her to be put down because I still love her unlike my parents and my sister. I also don't believe that she should be put down because of it. WHAT CAN I DO?!?!

to those who don't wanna read my... well,  whining the tl;dr version:  bitch's revenge -&gt; me  leaving

now the long story, for those of you who have time to kill because they're procrastinating work or bored =d
few months ago i founded Aperture Science, i happened to be on right after the update with enough cheese. it was meant to be a room 3 tribe, but with the constant inviting of friends/ friends of friends it kinda went out of hand and it became a shitload of people i didn't know under the same tribetag.
after a while people started leaving because they were annoyed by the amount of strangers to them and i joined that trend.
later 4 people decided to gather up the ones that were kinda close to each other, downsizing from &gt; 70 to 30 people and we got together for 'lessthanthree'(i wasn't in the decisionmaking progress - just reinvited, thus no influence on the name :p)
that lasted for a while, but soon people started drifting off again.
so Lasoaj told me about his plan to recreate a tribe, with his list of 18 people that were really active, talkative and nice, i agreed to it and came up with a name (Mercury) and opened it up making him the only spirit chief, because he suggested it. when i went to sleep(I'm on europe time) he hadn't talked to the others yet and we only invited 1 more person.
this morning i signed on and noticed that Lasoaj opened up another tribe. i asked him what was up and he answered that he opened up a solo tribe. i just accepted it, even though i was pretty pissed that he left Mercury without leaving a spirit chief, ruining that tribe.
 
When i came home from class and signed on I noticed Mandolin on and she was in that tribe. I asked what's up, she said she forced andy into taking her into the tribe, jokingly about it.

Well 2 hours ago i signed on and noticed 2 more people were in that tribe. i confronted one of them and first they didn't say anything. shortly after Lasoaj signed on - i was still messaging on of those 2.
i asked why the fuck doesn't laso just tell me that why he didnt want me in the tribe. i got asked what i did to Mandolin.
I was confused. o.o 
So here's what happened. Apparently i said something that upset Mandolin. If i did i definitely didnt mean to and she should know that.
She got pissed, but instead of showing me, she kept her nice facade towards me. She told everyone that i upset her though and convniced them that they didn't want me in the new tribe. good thing that i just found out 30 minutes ago that she was upset huh. couldn't be mature about it o.o

I lost interest in the game few weeks ago and just bootcampd with some of them to kill time (silly of me to think of them as friends)
Now that i got backstabbed by her i'm 500 cheese short and lost most of my tfm friends there's nothing holding me on that site - so i'm parting with the tfm community.

Almost all the participants successfully completed the month (one gave in to a meatball sub on something like the third day) and it was a great time.  I felt great by the end and managed to drop a few pounds, all while trying lots of new foods and learning how to cook new dishes.

I work for an electronics retail store and have for a few years now so the stress of holidays is nothing new. Today was definitely a first for me. We had a customer come into my store asking to purchase a kindle. One of my employees nicely explained to him that we were currently out of stock and he seemed pretty upset so she asked for an MOD to come speak with him. unfortunately, I was the first person to respond to the page. I greeted the customer and he was perfectly pleasant at first. He asked why were out of stock of something we advertise and how he could get it. I explained how they were a very popular item for the season and even checked other locations for him to pick it up at. During our conversation he started to ask about other e-readers so i gave him a demo of the Nook, explaining everything he asked about and comparing it to the kindle. I offered to drop the price of the Nook to match the Kindle for the inconvenience, which he seemed happy with and decided to go ahead and purchase it for his wife.
 At the moment i lean down to pick the nook up he whispers to me in an angry voice "" One of these days I'm going to come in and shoot all you mother fuckers with a machine gun!"" 
I immediately stand up and tell him to get out of my store and never ever come back. He says "" If you dumbasses would just carry what you advertise I wouldn't have to do that would i? Fuck off."" and storms out of the door...........
What the hell is wrong with people? How is not having an item in one store enough to threaten a persons life? I just don't understand how some people can react how they do in retail stores. I hope you all have a happy holiday. Apparently i'm getting taken out by a machine gun for mine... hah

Day 56- Ticket sent to the Ministry Of Justice Collections unit (becoming a fine) and a $30 court cost is added (no hearing type thing its literally a collection cost, if you want a hearing or ave a dispute you have to write to the authority PRIOR to it arriving in court REQUESTING IT SPECIFICALLY).

A further 28 days after this the fine become ""Enforceable"" and can have action taken to collect the outstanding fine (Warrants to Seize Property, Attachments to Wages or Benefit, Deductions from Bank account).  This incurrs a $100 fee.

You can also set what is called a Time to Pay arrangement where you can pay a bit off each week (court officers discretion to allow this).

This is one of the scariest things I've ever had to deal with and I can't stress to you, reddit, that I take this pretty seriously now. This is a story about a creature that has been spotted throughout the United States that makes any other creature story seem, basically pussy. But before you downvote or press back, I have pictures of this creature so take this all in and then look at the photos after you've read this:

About a year and a half ago my sister called told me that she was driving and saw something so absolutely terrifying that she almost wrecked. She told me that she was sitting at a red light and up in the tree there was this person walking near the top. At first she didn't really take it in and thought it might have been a worker. She then looked up and realized he was completely faceless. He was almost naked and very pale and had no face but possibly a mouth. This ""person"" was walking back and forth above a busy intersection that would have been incredibly dangerous, let alone the fact that it seemed almost impossible that the tree could have supported his weight at the top of it. She said he also seemed to be in a daze and sort of glide back and forth across the top of the tree with little effort. 

I heard this, forgot about it, thought it was dramatic and over-the-top and moved on. Then my friend and I were talking about childhood and he reminded me of this time that his brother saw some weird naked guy in his backyard. He told me that his brother thought the guy had no face and was not really a human. He seemed to crawl and was sickly pale. This is when I started to get goosebumps, and as I write this right now I assure you, I have them now. I told my sister that she wasn't alone in the sighting and decided to look some stuff up. I found several things online that pointed to some similar stuff about faceless crawling people that lived in caves, the stuff of fairy tales right? Wrong. I created a facebook group about it just because I thought it was funny right? Next thing I know there's a few hundred members and I'm getting posts every week about some person that’s seen this white faceless crawling naked thing. I find that there are regional names for this monster, up north its called something like a banshee, in the south its called the white thing or white thang. 

So I go about my life thinking this is pretty interesting but it's probably not real. At the very lease its probably some sort of dog with mange or something sociological. That's before tonight when I received a picture from a girl in the group. She claimed that photos of it popped up. This is what she said ""i have a picture of this creature on my phone that was taken 11/30/2010 @ 1:44:12 am on a restricted hunting ground in point pleasant, wv. it is real, and very scary looking. ""

You can join the facebook group its The Alabama White Thang. The wall is filled with people posting stuff about seeing it. I also have an inbox filled with sightings. What should we do? This is scarier than any cryptozoological creature.

**EDIT**
Many people keep saying that it is part of a viral video campaign. There is little evidence of this link other than skeptics claiming this. The video that is supposedly linked to it is simply of a guy interviewing a girl about making a zombie movie. They don't claim to have made, or are linked to this single shot that is from a hunting camera on private property. 
ALSO the facebook group has hundreds of members and was created over a year ago. It has accounts of something described in almost the exact same manner that go back until the 70s. Also, the image on the group I drew after hearing accounts of the creature and they look very similar. The other issue is how skinny its arms are in comparison to its body and the shape of its upper brow. It also has a very large mouth, much larger than any person's mouth.

152957,"I'm wondering about advice, help, words, jokes, ideas, philosophies, riddles, puns or anything else that you might contribute to me and others who are also suffering.

I feel like I've lost some of my autonomy.

It's a long story, but the short version is:
1. I have had digestive troubles for over ten years now, I've never been very passionate about resolving this with doctors, though I am trying a homeopathic thing right now, but I know it just comes down to diet, exercise and stress... essentially day-to-day living and lifestyle.

2. I've always been intellectual and emotional, and have developed ways to think and learn from my suffering (thanks Buddhism)
unfortunately I still get stressed out sometimes...

3. I had a very important relationship almost exactly 2 years ago,
I have very fond and happy memories, but these reminiscings also have a negative effect, in that they cause real physical strain on my heart and strain on my perspective.

4. I currently work 5 days a week 4 hours a day. This is mostly due to me not being able to be reliable enough to have full-time hours, I have to be around a washroom a lot and some days I need to stay home due to either wanting to be around my own bathroom all day (yes pooping and cramps), and/or because my mood is shit and I'm exhausted because I'm not digesting food properly.  Thankfully, my job is pretty understanding towards my condition. 

6. I currently have quit smoking cigarettes after being addicted for over 10 years. (yeah! finally a gleam of victory :D ... gleam?)

7. I make enough money to pay my half of the rent and buy a bit of food each month to get by.

8. I need to create; I produce music, I draw cartoons, do digital art, jam ideas, write poetry.

9. I need to explore words and ideas; history, anthropology, spirituality, humanity, reality, science, alchemy, philosophy, technology, the seen and unseen, to find the bridge to the middle ground and perceive through multiple stories of multiple experiences and empathize with humans and their struggles and triumphs.

10. I don't have money to buy my parents or my sister anything, I am of course doing what I usually do and that's bringing data home for Christmas.  X-mas movies, x-mas songs (gotta burn bonny-m every year :), I usually have a few new songs from me for them.  I know that they don't mind, and that they are just happy to have me home for Christmas, but I feel like I wish I could provide...
anyway..
I guess my point is, I am having some difficult times during the holidays, I'm sure many of you know that not only can this season be stressful, but it amplifies when you are dealing with a not so perfect existence and you are trying to feel your way out of it.

I am looking forward to the new year.
I am thinking about going on social assistance, getting a social worker, asking them if I can get supplementary income to eat real food, pay my bills, get me stable, so my moods are good, so I can pick up more full-time work.  

any thoughts?

153301,"Background: My girlfriend and I have been dating for just over 18 months and we have been truley in love (and to an extent I still feel like I love her just as much as I used to) for a large portion of that time. It's just a lot of the time I feel that she's not actually the 'right' girl. I can't put my finger on why it is. I think a substantial part of that feeling is due to the fact that she's quite a simple person and maybe that's just not what I'm after? (Although she is my first serious girlfriend, hence why I am unsure)

Basically, when we were first getting to know each other, I was perplexed for the first few months because it seemed I was hardly getting to know her to any greater extent than I did in the first few weeks after meeting. I was puzzled, but then it hit me that there was actually *nothing else to know about her*. It sounds harsh I know but it's quite true, and hey I'm not holding that against her at all, she's just relatively simple, and maybe I'm after a 'challenge' or something?

Currently we're on summer break and living about 1000km apart, and I'm now at the point where my texts and calls have become sparse (completely from my end - she's still as keen as beans). She knows this and has been asking questions - even asking if I'm going to break up with her. The truth is, I *don't* want to break up with her, because I love her, but at the same time I can definitely feel something is not quite there and I'm almost certain my future doesn't lie with this girl (I was previously convinced it would). 

I just need some kind of advice or help. I don't really know what I'm feeling. When she asked me if I was going to break up with her there was some asshole cutting onions right next to me...

We're planning on taking a trip up to Sunapee next week before Christmas and I would like to make a ""detour"" and stop by the Charles and propose there; most definitely at night. Is the Charles frozen yet? Are there any good areas where it's accessible and we can park our car nearby? Looking at Google Maps, I am thinking preferably near the Christian Herter Park, because the river isn't that wide and it looks like public space.

Before anyone points it out... of course we won't go on the ice if it is weak... in that case it would be by the river, not on it. Somewhere close, somewhere nice...

So, as for the Miyazaki movies. I have not watched Kiki, Porco Rosso, Totoro. I am definitely going to watch those. I have watched and plan on rewatching these during this marathon: Spirited Away, Nausicaa. Any suggestions on what else to watch to make myself feel a lot better?

154994,"My best friend is Alex. Alex is gay. I struggle to find out why I always say that first because it doesn't really have anything to do with the kind of person he is. Imagine saying you have a BMW, and then being compelled to always say, the trunk lining is blue, instead of describing its year, make, color, or model. Alex is a 1985, slender, white, “nicest guy in the world”. I'll spare any further introductions because you've already met me and my friend Alex. We are just those two guys you see hanging out at the movies but the seat between us, the ""gay buffer"", is an inside joke.

When we were both 17 Alex told me his secret, and when we were both 22 he told his parents his secret. Shortly after he showed up, unannounced, at my doorstep, broken, to tell me his story. My mind couldn't help but drift a little while he got it all out. 

I rewound nearly 10 years. My brother had been drinking, he was 16, and he was delivered, nearly unconscious, to my parents front door covered in party-sauce that his body decided it didn't want. My parents tended to him as if it were just the flu, but by morning when soberness came so too did all out battle. Both sides no doubt having a to-arms speech in their mind where some figure urged them to battle and gave confidence to their position that they, not the other, were to be in control of this 16 year olds life. 

I sat quietly in my room and did whatever it was that a geeky 13 year old did in 1998, but my main motive was to listen to my family cry war. I now don't remember much of what was said but I can still recall my father telling Arron, my brother that if he didn't like the house rules he could leave. Arron wasn't a bad person; he was just trying to be himself. He is still, at 28, the same guy that goes out and has way too much to drink. He also still, though he owns his own home, basically still lives with my parents. I can always count on him already being there if I need to stop by for something. I know that if anything ever happens to my parents as they age that my brother will be there, hopefully sober.

I also had my problems, but they may seem less severe. Beyond Alex, I had no friends. I sometimes felt like we, Alex and I, clicked, not because we were compatible, but because we were too scared to try to fit in, or didn't want too. I, later in high school, began skipping classes. I, later in high school, like Arron, also had battles with our parents. I was never told that the rules were the rules and if I didn't like it I could move out. My parents yelled, and blew up in the same way they did with Arron, but at the end of the day they gave me a long leash, and helped me eventually find a small school I could transfer to where I felt like I fit in. 

I day dreamed through Alex's sobs, and I remember always feeling like Arron had softened my parents up. As if my truancy was small potatoes in the light of my brothers binge drinking. As if, who cares if the younger one stays out till 2 AM watching classic movies when the older one is out till 4 AM drinking.

I'm ignoring Alex. I'm only hearing half of what he is saying. He says his parents said they will never have grandchildren, but then I see my brother getting physical with my dad and being pinned to a chair to stop the flailing of his fists. I feel the sting at the side of my face when I said something only an angsty 17 year old would say to his mother, and she momentarily lost control of her right hand. I can hear my father yelling. I can hear doors slamming.

Alex has gotten to the point where I can’t understand him and he has to stop talking to breath. I hug him and have one final flash back. I'm 18, I haven't graduated yet, but I'm close. I've done something stupid, I can't remember what. My teenage memories are two separate chains of stupid things I've done and arguments I've had as a result. Which argument goes with which stupid act I couldn't say. This particular argument doesn't go as anticipated. My dad sits, as opposed to standing over me. He's quiet, almost not there, as I am with Alex right now. For several minutes he isn't making sense but finally gets to the point. 

“We've always told your brother that if he didn't like our rules he could just find another place to live. I've never once made that offer to you. Do you know why?”

“No...”

“Because your mother and I both knew you would leave. Your brother needs us, and we know you don't.”

At 18 I felt an immense amount of pride and validation hearing that. I was independent all along and hadn't had anything to prove. I proved it all when I was 9 and packed a bag to run away. I love my parents, but I don't need them. I choose to be with them because they are my friends. The point of this information had always escaped me until now, holding Alex, trying desperately to stop daydreaming and listen to him.

I break my grasp; push his shoulders back so I can see his face. I finally break my silence and tell him one word.

Leave.

EDIT: As an attempt to not offend anyone else ""leave"" means, ""leave your parents"", not ""get out"".

154996,"I'm 22 male and from the UK, over a year ago my fiancé died, she was 21 I will call her J and we met at university and moved in together. Planned a life together, she was truly my soul mate. We were expecting a baby on the 22nd of September last year, I know it wasn’t like we planned it but I was glad to be starting a family with her she had just graduated university and I was working as a software developer. I remember all the little moments with her like picnics in the park, choosing the cot (crib if you are American), we even went through baby names together. We told our respective parents and they were pleased. We moved into our new home that my Dad owned a small 2 bedroom house.

Then it happened 8 months into her pregnancy I got a phone call, she was at home with her friend and bleeding heavily. They took her to hospital and I left work and drove there. 3 hours later she had died of heart failure due to complications with our child. My daughter Amy made it out alive my love did not , she never got to know her daughter, I went home and cried for about 3 months nonstop , tried to be a good father , my parents helped a lot I had no idea how to take care of me and my daughter. I kept going into work by I distanced myself from everyone including my friends; I just didn’t know what to say.
Her parents have never helped us they blame me and our child for killing their daughter, I wasn’t even allowed to go to her funeral, they even stopped me on the day from entering the church i sat in the car with my daughter crying. I talk to my fiancé every day I know she’s not there but it makes me feel better.

I still don’t know what to do, I know I’m not an attractive prospect for women now I have a daughter and her mother is dead, I’m not very well off. I struggle even to buy things day to day my Dad gives me money but I could hardly even take a woman out on a date.

My question how can I get over this and move on?
Update:

Thanks for the advice I don't really know how i'm going to have christmas this year, I think I will have 2 days off but I really needthe money so my parents have offered to take Amy for the day. I just miss having people to talk to its odd my daily routine is wake up at 5am go to work til 5:30, get a train , then a bus to my house. Drive to my parents from there pick amy up ,drive home . Eat a meal go to bed. On the weekends I normally wake up at 6 go to bed when amy falls asleep , it is not really a life but its the only onw I have now and I have to live for my daughter now and keep going.

Christmas will be terrible this year as it was last year, going to put some flowers on J grave then go back to work, I saved up some money to buy some I will feel guility about that too I suppose , that they are not good enough.

My friend was caught in a sting operation. The narc told cops it was MDMA, I assume. The field test was positive for MDMA. But it's not MDMA. My friend never claimed it was MDMA when setting things up with the narc (although the narc kept insisting on 'that molly') or when being questioned-he didn't say shit. It's pure mephedrone, this is a fact. I've read that field tests will do this.

He is looking at two counts of felony distribution for two occurrences. 

I've suggested he have his lawyer get a sample tested, to prove it's not MDMA, and try to negotiate charges down to  intent to distribute a counterfeit.   

This happened in Virginia, where mephedrone is unscheduled. It is being handled by county police, thus they are not invoking the Federal Analogue Statute. The police don't know that it's mephedrone, they think it's MDMA/molly. 

My friend hasn't said shit to the cops. He has some priors though.

I have mobile me which comes with the Find my Iphone app. I tracked the phone all day moving around after I lost it until finally the battery went dead and/or they turned it off and removed the sim. The last location it was located at happened to be about 3 hours from where the phone was lost and about an hour and a half from me. Through some googling i found out the owner of the house and got a phone number. I confirmed through a relative that a person in the house was indeed at the same location as me on the same day. This is where it gets tricky. The owner now refuses to answer my calls. I called the local police who then gave them a call, and they called me back saying the relative inquired about the missing phone and that the person in question did not have it. The police said they can't do anything else. Should i just cut my losses and move on? It's not really about the phone anymore.

155639,"Generally, I am in favor of government transparency, and I believe it's very important for the more serious Wikileaks material to be publicized so that it can be prevented in the future (evidence of torture, fudged death numbers, etc). And on many levels, it worries me that governments have freaked out to the point that they have about all of this.

However, none of this makes me feel qualified to say whether or not the entirety of the leaks were justified, or whether or not Assange and Manning belong in prison. I have not read all of the documents, and even if I had, I don't know enough about diplomacy or US military operations to know whether some of them may have compromised important US or other interests and lives; very few people actually do.

Manning willingly broke the law as well as the agreement in his security clearance, and as a member of the armed forces, he has knowingly forfeited some of his constitutional rights. Now, I do not believe that he should be tortured under any circumstances, and I don't know whether the good he did in leaking the documents outweighs the bad, but I am willing to let him sit in jail for a little bit while we sort all this out (again, I am adamantly against his being detained in inhumane conditions).

Similarly, Assange has probably done both good and bad with the leaks. As he is not affiliated with the US, I don't think the US can punish him (pinning it all on him is pretty stupid anyway, in my opinion). However, I find it disconcerting that people, especially on Reddit, are willing to completely throw out his rape charges because they ""might"" be fabricated. It is possible that he is being scapegoated, and that the charges are all false. However, it is possible he actually raped someone, and if he did, he should be locked up for a long time, even if he is the face of Wikileaks. I do not have nearly enough facts to say if either of these is true.

Why is everyone so uncomfortable with admitting that they don't know what the right thing is yet? Why can't we wait for more facts to be determined, or better yet, find the facts ourselves if we're interested?

So please, continue making your informative, interesting, and important posts about Bradley Manning's torture, the real contents and effects of the leaked documents, and the actual news about Julian Assange. But I, and probably a lot of other people, would really appreciate if you cut down on the ""Assange/Manning is a god and Big Brother is here"" circlejerk.

I have absolutely no experience with microcontrollers, and I was interested in creating an automated nerf sentry turret (basically a fully automatic nerf gun mounted on two moving servo motors that tracks movement). The microcontroller will ideally be operated via USB (The motion tracking device will feed into the laptop, which will process the input and transmit instructions to the gun), and will control the firing mechanism (basically just a 0 or 1 current over a wire, from what I can tell), and the rotation of both servo motors.

155696,"Dear Reddit.com,

I'm going to be turning 25 in a couple of weeks and I have been reflecting on my childhood life...
When I was around 3 or 4, my Mom and Dad had already divorced and my sister and I were living with our father, the pastor. One day, we got picked up from our school by the police and were taken to the police station where we waited for our Mom. Our Dad had apparently been charged with lewd lascivious acts and sexual battery of an underage boy.

Me and my sister lived with our Mother, who hopped around from guy to guy (6 marriages, 5 guys) in an effort to ""provide"" for us, until we both came to our senses, realized our Mom was crazy and moved out when we were 17.

About a year ago, I had found out that through my sister that our father had gotten out of jail, she sent me a link to his ""sexual offender"" flyer. It provided his address, as required by law, and I decided to send him a letter. Ya know the angry letter you're suppose to write and not send? Well, I sent it.

To my surprise, my hateful letter was responded to with a message of love and regret.

I recently spent some time with my Mother during Thanksgiving and at one point we had a bit of a heated argument (as family members do) where she said something about how I was ""just like him.""

For one, this disturbed me. And secondly, it made me think that I should probably write him a response letter only I have no idea what to say. A friend of mine suggested that I meet with him in person, and that meeting with his real father (he was adopted) really helped him.

I'm kinda stuck on the fence, I mean, I want to see my Father before he dies, but I don't know how I can forgive and then forget him. I think that the forgiveness might just spark a reconciliation that I don't want.

Now that sounds awful bitter, and it is, so why bother? That's an easy one. There are [certain forces of nature](http://www.foxnews.com/) who would have you believe that when Atlas drops the ball, we should blame the next titan who tries to shoulder it. Worse, they'll stack the cards against the neophyte and undermine him at every possible juncture, all to preserve a narrative. As the economy recovers under enemy rule, that great Vitirol Dynamo will sputter and falter, and its ratings will plummet and its clout will vanish. Its Hail Mary tactic is to just keep spinning in spite. Its prerogative is to keep the economy from recovering, and force-feeding the economy misinformation that it is not recovering seems to do the [trick](http://www.alternet.org/story/149193/study_confirms_that_fox_news_makes_you_stupid/null).

But you're smarter than that, and you don't buy into that narrative in the slightest, so why must we keep on that horse? Because it's too easy for the economic woes to get you down this time of year, and if you can't catch the culprit you'll find a scapegoat. A phone bill will tear your family apart. A habit will bear its addiction. It's all too simple. It's human nature under pressure. And this is the time of the year when it will bear bitter fruit, and now is the worst possible time.

So go forth and bury the hatchets you share with people in your life. Even if you think they're to blame, they're really not.

Here are my questions:

* How long did treatment last?

* Was there any sort of functional analysis conducted?

* What about reinforcer assessments?

* How was data collected/behavior measured?

* What were the best and worst parts of treatment?

* Did the behavioral changes maintain long term?

* Was medication involved?

* Would you recommend BA to others?

In fact, the main reason these kids are sent to these schools is for the connections. Life is revealed to them as purely utilitarian and uncreative. The idea is to conform. This idea is reinforced throughout school, according to the Times, by cyberbullies. And in order to get that 180,000 a year when you are thirty, you have to have paid hundreds of thousands in tuition fees. What a great investment!""

Me: ""So did your mom set you up on that date?""

Coworker: ""Yea, doesn't your mom ever do that for you?""

Do I just blurt out ""No my mom is dead""? and kill the mod of everyone, even though it doesn't bum me out?

My 7-10 exam was turned into a 4-10 exam for my benefit, but due to the nature of the exam (multiple choice, one or two word answers, etc) I've finished early.

Now, I can't leave the exam room until 8 so I don't spread what I know of the exam. Irony: I was allowed access to the internet to let me spend my time. Technically, I could mass e-mail the other students in my class.

I want to state this clear from the start that I won't do so. Reveling in the irony is one thing, but I'm not about to have myself expelled.

The kicker is, I'm on a university meal plan, and the (very good) cafeteria closes at 8pm, with options decreasing rapidly past 7:30. By the time I get out of the exam room, I'll have missed dinner. I haven't eaten since 7:30 this morning.

158679,"Hey RA! I've heard you give some great advice in the past, so I come to you with my conundrum. 


I recently entered my first relationship ever. At the ripe old age of 22, I felt like the only thing missing in my life was a relationship. So once I had one, I was over joyed. 

Fast forward two months (the present), the girl and I are headover heels for each other. This isn't her first relationship, and she says ""we're too perfect for each other"". In some ways shes right. I haven't had a relationship, so I don't really know. But we get along really well and solve small arguments very quickly.

So I felt that she was ""the love of my life"" until yesterday. I was talking with some friends and all of a sudden, I felt like fog had been lifted from my brain. I still very much like her, but I am not sure if I like her so much that I see a future (marriage) with her. I know it is way too soon to be even discussing/thinking about that. 
I suggested we slow down a bit, because she was already discussing moving in together. 

She gets a little bit upset, and then says she understands completely and thinks that we should slow down as well. After a few days, nothing has changed. She is still staying at my place and we're just as close as ever. I don't want to get rid of her I have no problems with her staying with me. However I really do want to slow down a bit. I have a feeling if I'm going to really upset her. How can I approach this?

EDIT:: She says she'll probably never find love again etc. if I break up with her. She's been hurt in the past and I feel like I will be betraying her and damaging her permanently if I ever break up with her. I guess I feel a bit trapped.

158817,"To whom it may concern,
As for the final exam... well, needless to say, this was easily the most important final exam I've ever written in my entire 4 years at Univserity, as I graduate in spring 2011 with a B. Sc. Physics, I have been using my final elective credits as my pre-requisites for a certificate in Accountancy, which I plan to apply for at the Business School as soon as I'm officially graduated. This final exam will literally determine the rest of my life, and I'm sure I'm not the only person in this situation.


I arrived at the exam room for 6:30... half an hour prior the start of the exam. I had memorized mnemonics to help me remember all of the 15 profitability, liquidity and solvency ratios which were a good portion of marks on the final exam. I waited along with 150 other students, at the door of the class room while the invigilators inside, seemed to be standing around discussing something... 6:45 and the doors were still closed... 6:55 and still closed... at 7:05 they began letting people in. Now, I was already stressed given the circumstances of this exam, and I was getting more stressed as my concern for time grew.


they split the line into 2 groups, it was at this point I realized that half of these people weren't even in accounting 230, instead they were part of COMM 220.


At 7:10 I checked in, and sat down, organized all my various pens, pencils, ruler and calculator and began reciting my memory aids for ratios over and over so that I would not forget them or confuse the order of the letters. They had us seated in an alternating pattern of commerce and accounting students, so that no student from the same course would be seated next to another. which is a good thing!


....the exam was scheduled to start at 7:00 pm, I understand things can take time so I figured ok, not a big deal to start 15 minutes late... but it wasn't just 15 minutes late. 7:30 and there were still people in line waiting to be seated... they started giving out the exam booklets and instructed us not to write anything and not to turn them over. people were talking loudly, moving about, coming in and out of all the entrances and exits of the class room. The invigilators were literally yelling: ""Who is in COMM 220 raise your hand for an exam book"".


I know they started the official clock at 7:25 but the truth is, that we could not actually begin until much later, at 7:45 they were still seating people, and there were still people who had the wrong booklets, and wrong tests, students were still talking loudly. Around 8:00 pm the instructor for the COMM 220 course entered the room, she began speaking openly and loudly, talking about the exam her students were writing, she told everyone to write in the exam booklet in pencil, and finally there was silence.


2 minutes later, laughter broke out amongst the commerce students, people saying to each other loudly: ""these instructions are un clear!"", so the professor again spoke up, instructed her students to stop writing in pencil and write in pen from now on - students were getting up to their bags to get erasers and pens. She then explained that the booklet was only to be used for rough work and everyone should now re-copy their work into the exam papers. She made several more announcements over the course of the exam, each time declaring herself as a town crier might announce something of great importance, I assume she must not have realized there are more students in the class then just her own, and not everybody wants to be interrupted each half hour.


you might be asking yourself at this point: ""why are these details so clear to this accounting student?""... well that’s exactly my point... with an hour long delay, and an unacceptable amount of commotion and noise, when I finally started on the questions, I had forgotten all of my memory aids. Usually I can remember the mnemonics for an hour max, but the circumstances caused me to lose focus, and all my meaningful letters and symbols were junk now.


The point I would like to make here is that of principles. I believe, as a paying customer of this university, and a student of the Accounting department, I was slighted. I've written more than 30 exams in my career here and never once have I been so upset as I am with this exam. I answered every question to the best of my ability and as I reviewed my exam to see if I missed anything, I realized I would be losing about 20% of my grade right off the bat because I couldn't remember those ratios.


I understand it is my responsibility to learn the material and mine alone, but I feel that I also have rights to write my exam in a manner which is FAIR to all students... consider the fact that everyone in the course who's last name is between MA-ZZ was in a different room, 3 floors up, I would consider this, by the very definition of it, to be 100% un-fair.


the circumstance were NOT at all the same for both groups writing the exam, and I would even postulate a simple hypothesis to prove this theory. look at the test results, without a doubt, the marks will be on average, higher in the class that did not have so many disruptions. There is no logical argument that can be made to refute my claims, I've given this a lot of thought, and slept on this issue before writing this letter.


The bottom line is clear, an exam was given to 2 groups of students in the same course but situated in different surroundings. One group had the advantage of a quiet environment, and starting on time, and  minimal interruptions. While the other group started almost an hour late, was interrupted at least 12 times with trivial non-relevant - to accounting students anyways - information about a Commerce class and was surrounded by noise, chaos and disorganization.


Fair is not a word that can be used to describe the situation any longer, are there no regulations or rules regarding the writing of exams to protect the students from writing in an unfit environment? I very seriously contemplated standing up and professing my disgust with the situation and refusing to write the exam in such a situation, in hindsight perhaps I should have done so, maybe I could have written the exam at a later time if I were to have a ""sudden medical emergency"" or a panic attack from all the extra stress and the anxious environment. 


Lastly, I want to make the physical connection here that because the exam invigilators in my room were poorly organized, and the professor from the other class was causing chaos, I along with many other students, definitely suffered because of it. My grade will be at least 20% lower then it could have been if I was in the other room. This may have cost me my chance at entrance into Accounting, and altered my life for worse, for ever.

159379,"My last customer was a German man who was in town contracted to work on a project.  He was having computer issues and needed to have it looked at.  When he was checking it in on Monday I informed him that the estimated turn around time is 2 to 3 business days.  He needs to have it completed by Friday before he leaves back for Germany.  I presented him our rush service that would guarantee that his unit will be completed before then by placing him in front of all the other customers waiting in line.  He doesn't want to pay and I restate the turn around time and add ""could be shorter, could be longer, it is an estimate!""  

Fast forward to Wed and they are calling.  My wife, who is pregnant, had called me complaining of blood pressure issues, she was stuck in the bathroom and couldn't walk, and wanted to go to the ER.  I rush home to take care of that around 1pm.  They called some time after I left, my employee tells then he might get to it and if so will call them back after he performs some diagnostics.  Unfortunately, due to running the store by himself, he's unable to get to it.  

They call back the next morning and want to know what is going on with it.  By now, my employee has gotten it onto his bench and is scanning it for infections (so far about 11 already.)  At some time later he calls them about what is going on with it and how much it will take to fix it.  He approves the price, asks about time, is told it might be 3pm but he could call back in to check.  

He calls at 3:03pm and asks what is going on with the unit.  Unfortunately, my employee has just ran out to the store.  I check his unit and find the scan had completed and that once the tech returned I would have him call.  From then till 5:30pm we were rushed with customers, phone calls, and the demands of fixing our own machines.  My employee forgets to call and they come up to our store.

He starts to complain about the turn around time.  I show him his ticket that he signed.  The paragraph above what he has signed stated that we've informed him that our turn around time was an estimate, due to unforeseen circumstances we are not responsible if it takes longer, and that even the price could increase.

This is when I lost my cool infront of a customer in almost 5 years.  He looked at me and stated, ""You are just doing this because I am German! ...  If I was an American White you'd not be treating me this way!  I bet if I were Mexican or Black you'd treat me the same way!""

I basically told him I was offended that he'd act like that with me.  That, when he checked his computer in we'd discussed that I went to an international college where there were students from all around the world.  That many of the members of the fraternity that I belong to live all over this earth.  

Before they left they even asked for their diag fee back.  I let them know that we called and informed them of the issue.  That they agreed to the repairs and we were half way through with them.  I refused to refund it but might get burned for it later.

How could he think this of me?  I was upfront and honest about my turn around time.  I expressed I felt he needed to rush it.

I had to call the owner about the whole ordeal.  His wife stated she was going to call the BBB and other groups about how bad I handled the situation.  He's probably going to chew me out about this.  I hope it doesn't go further.

UPDATE:  So I just got a call from my old manager who is now our head on-site technician.  He had spoken with the owner who was asking him what to do.  He stated that with Christmas right around the corner, a baby on the way, tight on money, with stress from running a slow store due to the holidays can have on a person.  That I probably had my reason, that yes, I should have just given him his money back and be done with it.  When I speak with the owner tomorrow I'll have to see what happens from there.

UPDATE2:  I've just had a two hour meeting with the owner.  He's accused my co worker and I of failing to do an unrealistic work load.  That we've caused this issue to arise due to a 2-3day turn around time.  That our end numbers don't equate to how many units we take in every day.  That we should be 1 day out like our competition (I called around last time he made this argument... we've got the shortest in town on average.)  We get around 8-12 units a day.  I work on 5-6 a day myself.  Half of them at the moment are declining repairs due to cost alone.  Christmas is right around the corner and they don't want to pay.

Overall, I'm looking for a new job now.  I wasn't fired or anything, I'm just tired of dealing with the public directly.  I'm going to look for a job at a company where I don't have to worry about bottom dollar to keep the business afloat.  I just need to worry if Tammy in sales can get her email.

The driver replied, ""Yes sir, I have a 357 handgun in a hip holster, a .45 in the glove box and a .22 derringer in my boot.""

The officer looked at the driver and asked, ""Anything else?""

""Yes sir, I have a Mossberg 500 12 gauge and an AR-15 in the trunk.""

The officer asked if the man was driving to or from a shooting range and the man said he wasn't, so the officer bent over and looked into the driver's face and said ""Mr. Smith, you're are carrying quite a few guns. May I ask what you are afraid of? 

Mr. Smith locked eyes with the officer and calmy answered, ""Not a damn thing!""

I get what I need and head back toward the registers just in time to see register 1 opening up and a kid from the line to register 2 (still quite long) heading over to register 1. As the lady rings up his purchases I get in line behind him. 

He pays, heads out, and just as I set my bottle of tea down a woman from the other line walks over and promptly informs me that ""The line is back there."" I kind just gave her a deadpan stare and asked, ""The line for *this* register is back there?"" To which she had no ready response, but another woman from the line turned her chin up and shot me an icy ""Yes."" Not wanting to hold things up or create a scene, I thought fuck it, half-assedly apologized and moved. I had nowhere to be so a few extra minutes waiting wasn't a big deal.

So, was I in the wrong here? I mean I understand that if there's a long line and another register becomes available, the people who are next in line should be helped first. But when this register opened up, nobody got in line aside from the kid and, moments later, me. 

I also found it rather curious that this lady waited until it was my turn before walking over and shooing me to the back of the long line. I think she and this other woman were just tired of waiting. Looking back though I probably should have just asked the checkout lady.

Soo yeah. Your thoughts?

TL;DR -- Went to CVS. Register 2 had long line. Register 1 opens up but only one person moves. Got in line behind that person. Got chewed out for it as soon as it was my turn to ring up.

A week or so before Halloween I decided I wanted it and started tracking down someone who could claim ownership over the studio, and by extension the picture.  I looked up the business on google and tried to call the listed number, but it was disconnected.  So I called the city and tried to find out who owned the building.  It turns out the man who owned the studio and took the picture had died recently.  I was given the number to someone who owned a business in the building next door to the studio.  I spoke to them a few times and got the number to the current owner of the property.  I called that number several times, and no one ever picked up no matter how long it rang.  After a month I decided to try the guy next door and see if there was another way I could contact the owner or get into the building.

161728,"Before we can discuss the benefits of Oregano we need to establish what Oregano is. Oregano is a herb that belongs to the mint family. Originally from the Mediterranean, it is now cultivated Worldwide. Botanically it is called Oreganum Volgare, however there are about 40 subspecies of this popular herb, and the type that greets our palate as a spice and as a medicinal herb varies greatly. The spice known as Oregano is from the sub species Origanum Vulgare Hiritim also knows as Italian or Greek Oregano, There is also Marjoram which is at times packaged and distributed as the culinary spice Oregano. Here our interest lies upon the wild Oregano considered to be the most therapeutically beneficial.

Wild or Mediterranean oregano offers many therapeutic benefits not only to us humans but to our pets and home. Did you know oregano oil can help to get rid of fleas or to brush your dogs teeth, cats can benefits from the use of oregano also by brushing their furs with a few drops of Oregano essential oil or added to your pet's food or water. It is important that you do not apply the oil whether internally or topically to any pregnant animal. Oregano oil can stimulate menstruation and therefore abort the pregnancy. Because of Oregano anti parasitic properties it can also be used to get rid of enteric parasites such as intestinal worms in your pets. It is also known that oregano oil is effective against yeast or candida and urinary tract infections.

Oregano oil can be used to get rid of fleas; as you may know most commercial flea powders, sprays and shampoos are toxic and consequently may kill or debilitate you loving pet. Using Oregano Essential oil to treat with a bath. Use a mild pet shampoo or even baby shampoo, add 3-5 drops of Oregano Oil and Lemongrass oil or Citronella oil per cup of shampoo. Another alternative would be to add a few drops of Oregano oil and Lavender oil. This will drown the fleas and begin the repellent treatment. (Some pets may not like baths or cannot be bathed the following is also an effective treatment when applied twice weekly) While grooming your pets fur you may add a few drops to your palm (combined with coconut oil about a Tbsp) and and then massage it into their coat. Always massage along the grain of the fur, massaging against the grain will only flick the oil off and not allow it to get in contact with the skin. Remember most animals are even more sensitive to the effects of the oils than humans, they seem to have a natural affinity to the healing powers of the oils. It is recommended to use a slightly lower dosage on your pets or animals than you would upon yourself. Therefore dilute with some virgin coconut oil. Adding 2 or 3 drops of oregano oil to your pet's fresh water daily will help them void most internal parasites. Applying a half dropper of oregano oil in each infested ear twice daily will cure ear mites. After applying the oregano oil into the ear, massage base of the ear for 30 seconds to distribute the oil. Remove any excess oil from around the ear and discourage your pet or other pets from licking the treated area. This infection should clear up in approximately one week.

The benefits of Oregano is just as effective for humans as it is for your pets. Oregano oil has been used to treat and cure cases of yeast infections, ear infection, cold flu and and other nasal conditions and seborrheic dermatitis. Yes, for those of you (like myself) who are suffering from this very troubling skin condition Seborrheic Dermatitis, I can assure you Oregano Oil helps. Use it to massage your effected areas using a blend with coconut oil. If you are treating your scalp; again mix a few drops with coconut oil and massage into the scalp then wrap in a steam or shower cap and towel leave on for about an hour then wash, do this at least twice weekly. Your scalp will look shiny and clean, and you won't suffer the side effect of using some of the other recommended treatment offered by the medical fraternity. The side effects I am talking about are liver damage, thinness and redness of skin, skin irritation, kidney damage, seizures, alterations in taste to name a few. Adding a few drop of oregano oil to you pillow at night will help to clear up any nasal congestion and may even positively influence you asthma symptoms. Want to get rid of Nail fungus (Onychomycosis)? Another benefit of Oregano oil is to get rid of most yeast types nail infections how do you use Oregano to do this? Blend two drops of oregano oil with a teaspoon of coconut oil. Apply to the affected area at least 3 – 4 times daily for NOT more than three weeks and that's it. Why not use Lamisil you might say well here is the possible side effects liver failure, stomach aches, nausea, diarrhea, rashes and alterations in taste and you also save yourself some more money

Are you are suffering from Candida? If you have the oregano oil, add 1 to 4 drops in water or juice and drink twice daily for at least 3 weeks. If you find you are still suffering from the effect of Candida break for 2 days and start the regiment again for another 3 week if this doesn’t seem effect consult your doctor, you may be suffering from something else. If you don't have the oil, pour boiling water over some oregano leaves (preferable dried leaves) to make a tea. It is recommended that you also drink plenty of water after each dose to you flush yourself of toxins, pathogens and yeast that died as the Oregano oil does its work.

N.B there is Oil of Oregano which has been diluted in a carrier oil such as coconut oil, olive oil. Or jojoba oil, etc and then there is Oregano Essential Oil which is the pure undiluted oil from the oregano plant. I recommend you use Oregano essential oil always. Simply dilute using a carrier oil to get the recommended dosage, I recommend the use of virgin cold pressed coconut oil as your carrier oil.

The growing problem of antibiotic resistance has health authorities extremely concerned. Drug resistance does not develop against naturally occurring antibiotics such as Oregano Essential oil. As a completely natural remedy, patients also do not suffer from the side effects associated with powerful prescription drugs. It will not create more mutant strains of bacteria. It effectively kills bacteria of every variety using only tiny amounts. You need no prescription. It does not cost a fortune! However the use of Oregano oil can temporarily impair the body’s ability to absorb iron. Some patients may notice a small allergic reaction to the oil, in the form of rashes on the skin. If you take oregano oil with blood thinning drugs your blood pressure may drop too low and your blood may become too thin. Consult with your doctor before taking Oil of Oregano if taking these types of drugs. The use of Oil of Oregano is not recommended during pregnancy or while breastfeeding. Oregano Oil is essentially very safe though. It is also effective against fungus, parasites and viruses. It can be used externally and internally. There are no serious negative side effects.

No. My father and I were never very close, but that's about it.

Both.


3: you need help, are you in/have you had therapy? etc.

162384,"Maybe many of you already know this, but for the benefit of those who might not, I'd like to share some information that you may find interesting:

As [mentioned elsewhere](http://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/emym4/ore_position_chart_for_minecraft_126_diamond_lava/), your best chances at finding diamonds are around level 15 -- ten block layers above the highest bedrock layer. So if you want to intensely search for diamonds, you'll end up climbing up and down repeatedly, because you'll run out of wood for new picks, right? 

Also, if you go spelunking, you'll probably encounter monsters, and sooner or later lose health, requiring you to return to the surface, right?

Wrong on both counts. 

After just a little preparation, you can go deep underground and you'll *never* be forced to return to the surface. That's because you can harvest both wood and food underground.

Trees do not in fact require sunlight to grow. They do need:

* One dirt block for you to place the sapling on.
* Some torches around the sapling (later tree trunk). -- These count as light. I have never tried things with less than four (probably for aesthetic reasons), but it's possible that a single torch might do. It's however possible (unconfirmed) that the size of the tree might be related to the amount of light, so more torches might be better. Maybe.
* Enough space, and underground that means a large enough cave for the tree to grow in. This may not be the absolute minimum, but I find that having/making a 5x5x7 cave works well. 5x5x6 works too, but somehow I find that too cramped. If you clear 7x7x7 multiple spaces next to each other, you can even create a little underground orchard with spaces between the trees.

So this should cover you in terms of wood. Here are some pictures:

http://i.imgur.com/I9pSK.png http://i.imgur.com/oBiAj.png

You can also create small (or large) water holes underground. Somebody else mentioned that you can use just two buckets of water to get an unlimited amount. (I forget who that was.) You do that by digging a 2x2x1 hole, and pouring the two buckets into opposite corners. The water will fill the hole completely and stop flowing. You can then scoop as much water from that hole as you like. It will refill itself.  
What makes this extra interesting is that the fishing pole has recently been introduced, and you can use that to fish in that hole. This means you can get an unlimited supply of food from your water hole. If you don't turn several holes into a larger underground lake, i.e. if you really just fish from the 2x2 water hole, then you will have to stand back at an angle, and aim so that the bobber will actually float in the water and not stick to the wall or floor next to the hole. With a bit of practice though, you can angle those fish from in your water quite efficiently. Note that the fishing rod will break after a period of use, but there's a very convenient bug (or feature ;) whereby if you have two rods, and you keep them in different boxes in your inventory, and then use one, you can put the used rod on top of the unused one, and you end up with two unused rods again. This trick means you don't need to find new spiders to kill. 

So to get started with underground fishing then, you need: 

* Two buckets of water.
* (Preferably two) fishing rods.
* Some tools and wood to make a work bench with, so you can make a furnace, so you can cook the fish (for more health).

Lot's of cool action sequences. Liberal use of stunning effects and sound. LOVE LOVE LOVE the music. The acting I found passable but not great. I found it rarely if ever took you out of the experience. The story was kinda cool but definitely had a few cliche moments/ideas. The dialogue often relied too heavily on nonsense technical jargon. But these are small niggles as I found the overall experience was pretty damn awesome.

I do have a few caveats. I've never seen the original and I am often fascinated to see where movie effects are going. I love movies with cool aesthetics(The Matrix, Blade Runner) and Tron is absolutely gorgeous. So if you're a fan of the original, I have no idea how this will strike you. Also, if special effects don't do it for you and you are looking for a great deal of complexity and substance below the aesthetics, this might not be your kinda movie.

Also, I saw it in IMAX 3D. The IMAX was worth it for the BANGING soundtrack alone, but the 3D was pretty pointless in my opinion. If you can see it at IMAX and save a couple bucks by not seeing the 3D version, I don't think you'll be missing anything.

But I thought it might be an interesting idea to be the boss at the bottom, and to influence the forces on each level of the dungeon to face a party of maybe five computer controlled adventures who are trying to kill me / steal my treasure.

The goal being to coordinate the creatures on the levels to wear down the adventures and make them give up and try to escape to the surface.

164086,"Dear redditors, I need your help and I need it desperately. Here's why:

A couple of days ago [I explained the drastic turn of events](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/em55g/i_did_a_grave_mistake_in_the_recent_past_and_now/) in my relationship with my lovely, lovely, lovely girlfriend.

I did a mistake, or rather I was about to. But I realized just in time that I was about make one and how horny and irresponsible I am. So I decided not to do it. But apparently, not making a mistake is not a success by itself. 

As you can guess, (if you clicked the link above and read that one, of course) she decided that it was a pretty failure in my own part and  called it quits. I tried to explain how it was almost like porn and how it was a silly thing and how stupid I was and how we don't have any strip clubs here and I admitted my guilt and told her how much I love her and how I only desire her and how, oh how I don't need anybody else but only her. But as you may know, in the moment of crisis and cries and shoutings, most of the words spoken go unheard and feelings unattended or unheeded, as anger masters over everything. As a result of this (or being really pissed off about my excuse on stripclubs) she didn't take a step back and has left my emails, text messages (even Last FM messages -see how desperate I am?-) unanswered to this moment. 

For me, it just started to sink and I feel like I just swallowed a giant murlock trying to make its way out of my stomach. It hurts, it hurts like the fist of an angry god, and feels like the first day one starts high school; weird, empty and full of braces. I can't eat, talk to anyone about it and I'm feeling like I'm just a slave-man in borderworld Xen who's about to make a choice between two bad alternatives, plus I don't have a crowbar, if I had, I would crash crates and feel a bit relieved. Though I do sleep, it's not restful. It feels awkward and sad waking to a world without her. 

I hope I did explain myself, even a bit. For now, I can't do much but wait. Elders say that time heals everything and I should wait for her decision but I'm afraid that her decision is final. But I know how awesome reddit is, (you even started a fucking rally!) how awesome _you_ are and I ask of you this: 

* Please take a picture of yourself holding a sign with the words ""He's sorry"" or ""he's a good guy actually"" ""He loves you"" or ""he's almost OK"" anthing funny, lovely you can think of that will help me in this quest. 

* Post it here as a comment and that's it.

Hopefully, I'll show this page to her and we'll be together again or better; she may even become a redditor, too!

164224,"Reddit I apologise in advance for this absolutely pathetic diatribe, I understand if you don’t read it. 

I recently moved to a new city for college, I don’t really know anyone, I have been at college for a year but I have not made any friends, I live by myself and have no job, my days are spent browsing reddit, sleeping or playing video games, I have no motivation for study and am only just scraping through using the absolute bare minimum of effort needed. I can feel myself spiralling towards depression, I’m not suicidal or anything like that but I can definitely feel myself being pulled deeper and deeper into a hole that will just become harder to break free from. The loneliness is absolutely crippling, I can go days without speaking to anyone, this is coming from someone who has always valued large amounts of alone time and I feel absolutely pathetic for needing social interaction this badly as it has never been something I’ve valued all that highly.

The thing is I am not that socially awkward, I can handle day to day interactions just fine and hold a conversation reasonably well, I am also reasonably pretty, I just don’t know how to make friends, the relationships just aren’t developing and I know it’s because I don’t put myself out there, if I am not the one being approached I will simply not talk to anyone.

I am unable to pull away from my comfort zones, I don’t approach people because I’m terrified of making a fool out of myself, or that I’ll look pathetic, I am constantly lying to people about myself, like if people ask what my living arrangements are I’ll lie and say I’m living with some friends, or give a vague answer about the area and hope they don’t pry further, if people ask what I did on the weekend I’ll give a vague answer about going out drinking, when in reality I would have been spent the entire time in front of a computer. I don’t let people become to involved with my life because I’m afraid they’ll think I’m a weird, pathetic, lonely person who’s been living here for a year but still has absolutely no friends, I’m so desperate to maintain my façade of being a well adjusted, normal individual and that itself is a big barrier in being able to change myself to fit the face I’m projecting.

I’ve had plans for awhile about how I could go about changing things, the usual join a gym, club or volunteer but I always rationalise out some excuse not to, like exams are coming up, or Christmas or something stupid like that, I’ve considered moving in with some randoms but I rationalise that away because I still have a few more months left on my lease which I can’t break, and again I don’t want to explain why I was previously living by myself.

I’m unable to leave my comfort zones, I know nothing will ever change if I don’t, I know there’s no point in sticking to old routines if they don’t accomplish anything, and that my choice is either do nothing or make some change and accept that I’m very likely going to make a dick out of myself a good amount of the time but if I don’t nothing will change, but I can just never convince myself to make that leap and I’m terrified that I’m wasting what should be the best years of my life.

164294,"Lots of useless back story: About two years ago I adopted a six week old puppy that was thrown in the trash outside a convenience store. I loved that little guy, and thought I did an OK job raising him. To get ready I read multiple books, took him to classes, etc...., but he would still jump up on people, bark at the doorbell, and become overly aggressive with his kisses. He was a good dog, just not the best manors.

So after my girlfriend left, she took the dog with her. There was a massive hole in my heart, and I still looked for him every time I came home. To avoid filling the void with some random dog, I promised myself I would take my time. I've spent the six months looking for a dog, and its taken a whole lot of patience not to adopt every dog I've met just because they're cute. I finally found one with a personality I love, but she's only six months old. I swore I wouldn't adopt a puppy again, but she's very well behaved, loves attention, and is a lazy bag of bones when someone is petting her. In short, I fell in love with [this little lady](http://i.imgur.com/JlwPH.jpg). She was everything I was looking for, so I wouldn't let her become euthanized just because she was young.

I asked Reddit for [help with a name](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ekrba/i_need_help_naming_this_little_lady_what_would/), and I think I've settled on Penny, but maybe I like Madeline more, or.... - I don't know. I really am still having trouble with this part. She's a passive dog and I love movies. Any ideas?

Anyway, the real question I wanted to ask /r/pets is if they have any tips for raising puppies. I want to make sure this girl stays who she is, and I don't want to ruin her because I think I'm trying to be stern with her raising. I've always been bad with punishing a dog - I just don't know how to. I would give a 'No', followed by petting after they stopped. Is there a timeout method you guys use? What do you do for encouragement?

**tl;dr** - I'm getting a new puppy, and I don't want to ruin her. Done this before, but want to do it better. Help me with your great advice.

I was thinking about my own personal issues and thought this might be a healthy forum for discussion. **No man is an island, so whatever it is, get it off your chest!**

I've always had problems with weight, or specifically *lack* thereof. I wasn't anorexic, I was just horribly lazy. In high school I'd sleep through first period, roll out of bed and go straight to 2nd period without breakfast. Skip lunch to do the homework that I blew off the night before, then come home and nap without eating, so I could stay up late to play video games. I'd wake up, have a quick dinner and that would be the only food for me all day. Ultimately, I graduated high school at 6'1"" tall weighing, generously, 120 pounds.

Not much changed in college, my terrible eating habits continued but I got horribly self conscious about my skinniness. Started wearing layers and layers of clothing to try to hide it. Even in the 90 degree heat of summer I'd wear long pants and long sleeves, afraid to show my complete lack of buttocks and biceps. I graduated college around 128 pounds.

About that time I had a moment of clarity, or terror, that made me change my habits. I was on my way out of a movie theater when a gigantic jacked guy grabbed me by the shoulder and spun me around. Right in my face: ""You bumped into my woman; apologize."" I was completely sure he had mistaken me, but I was fucking terrified at his size and the fact that he was basically crushing my shoulder. I caved like a bitch and apologized, and the next day started working out and buying protein mix.

Fastforward to now, I'm still slim at 165 pounds but I'm just starting to get comfortable in my own body. I can rep 185lbs 7-8 times on the bench press which I think, for my weight, is pretty damn good. Especially considering I started benching with just the bar...

I'm still plenty insecure. Despite my friends and family telling me I'm in good shape, I want to gain more weight. My girlfriend recently mentioned how being with me makes her feel like she needs to start running because I'm so skinny. I think she meant it as a compliment, but hearing that word ""skinny"" made me furious inside. My dad tells me there will come a day when I *wish* I were 165 pounds, which only pisses me off. Whenever I go out I'm always conscious of anyone bigger than me, it brings up my insecurities and I purposely avoid their vicinity if possible.

I think if I hit 180 pounds I'll be satisfied. I hope.

165589,"When I ask the atheist why he bothers arguing with the Christian on Reddit, he invariably responds that he is attempting to curb the legislation of Christian morality that threatens to dehumanize his gay brother, villify his feminist wife, and indoctrinate his children.  He will then generally counter with, ""I have no problem with you believing the way you do - but I want you to stop voting and procreating.""

I believe this is a lie.  

I mean, for obvious reasons the atheist does have problems with Christians procreating, voting, and generally believing in fairytales.  But that's sure as hell not why they're on Reddit.  I think that atheists engage Christians, particularly on Reddit, for several reasons, and it's rarely as altruistic as defeating the injustice of the Inquisition.

- **They enjoy feeling intellectually superior.**  It's probably fun debating a smart Christian, but I imagine it's a singular joy when the Christian's response is ""just believe,"" ""answered prayer,"" ""Lewis's trilemma,"" ""Holy Ghost,"" ""spiritual encounters,"" or ""watchmaker argument.""  (Appeal to faith, confirmation bias, excluded middle, god-spot, infrasound, Hoyle's fallacy.)

- **They want an outlet to react.**  With religion pervading culture, influencing the child's earliest thoughts to the very president's words, I'm sure it's nice to kick back in a largely atheist environment and take out your frustrations by hopping on /r/Christianity and posting a couple of brain-busters about the maundering incoherence of faith or the sadism of the Old Testament God.

- **It's a fun game with easy rules.**  I assume most of you haven't read the Koran, right?  Bhagavad Gita?  Probably a few have read the Talmud.  The point is, you debate Christians on Reddit because you already know the drill.  Other religions are only ever brought into the fray as ancillaries to the meat and potatoes of Jesus-baiting.  ""Joshua stopped the sun?  Interesting, 'cause Mohammad split the moon!""

- **They want a reason to believe.**   I agree, it's probably not many.  But I feel like a few of them are probably grasping at straws following a lifelong charge at an invisible windmill, dealing with the maddeningly inexorable loss of their parents' religion and the philosophy that will invariably replace it.  They'll jump at any argument to return to Christianity - an argument that will never come.

If /r/atheism is *actually* trying to change Christians' minds, it's obviously not very tactful or effective (generally speaking).  I'm not saying you guys don't drag a Lutheran or two kicking and screaming to the dark side.  Simply that that's not your objective. 

So I want to hear the three words I've longed to hear from /r/atheism since I joined Reddit: ""We love you.""  Wait - that's not it.  I meant, ""You're *kinda* right.""

Negativity.  Whether it be from others or from ourselves, negativity can disrupt the progress that you have made for yourself.  In my case, I have a roommate that while supportive at face value, seems jealous of my lifestyle change.  You must be thick skinned in situations such as these.  When a person decides to lose weight or gain muscle, it doesn't go without notice amonst friends and family.  And while it would be ideal for everyone to be supportive, there is a great possibility that you will come across someone that is the opposite.  Actions can speak louder than words.  And having friends that try to continually convince you to eat something you shouldnt or go out drinking instead of working out can be counterproductive.  Of course we all have days where we want to relax.  As you should.  But be wary of patterns that start to rear their heads.  I'm going to take a [direct quote](http://www.suite101.com/content/negative-comments-can-disrupt-weight-loss-programs-a300199) :

**""For many people who have decided to control their weight in a healthy way, this aspect is a hurdle often more difficult to manage than the new food choices to be made. The dieter can start to feel the group is not as friendly or welcoming… perhaps acting differently in some subtle way.**

**When those in a group generally share the same issues, such as being overweight, they feel a sense of acceptance. They ease any apprehension they may have about their health and wellness by reminding themselves they are not alone with this issue. However, when one or two in a group change the status quo, then the rest feel anxious and reminded that their behaviors too need changing. People may feel envious of the dieter’s new empowerment and determination and often there are feelings of jealousy.""**

In short, be aware of what is going on around you.  Resilience is key.  Be strong!  We are in this together and it is not without hurdles.

166689,"My friend (let's call her Jane) is adopted, she was adopted when she was around four-years-old. Jane came from South America to the USA. Her adopted father would do things she did not approve of and made her watch adult movies between the ages of eight and 11. She is now 19. She has told counselors at high school, and stuff like that. She had a recording of her dad confessing that he did it because his father would rape his sisters. Jane confronted her mother about it and gave her the recording. Her mom was in denial and destroyed the evidence. One night Jane's mom drunk dialed Jane, and confessed that she was only with her father for the money to get through tough times, and that she is sorry she couldn't help. 

When Jane talked to her high school counselor, the county began an investigation. After a while, they finally visited her father, and gave him a lie-detector test. He passed it, and the county dropped it since Jane had no real evidence. Her only sibling takes the parents side. Her brother is afraid of what will happen to their father if he admits that their father really did things in the past.

Jane was recently kicked-out of her home because she has been very short tempered, and things would easily trigger her memories of her father. Basically she snapped if the dad looked at her wrong. Her parents knew she was at risk, and are afraid that she might tell someone that will put her father away. So they decided to kick her out. She now stays with some friends, and is currently working two jobs trying to go to college.

She has tried to go to family friends, but as of Thanksgiving, her parents have already talked to everyone of their close friends. They have basically told them that Jane was traumatized when she was younger, before she was adopted, and that she blames her father for things he didn't do. She feels very hopeless and hates that her father is getting away with no consequences. 

What can we do? Who should we talk to? I'm thinking a Social worker might work, but Jane is afraid that they won't believe her because of the lack of evidence. She was very upset that the County didn't give her a lie-detector test, and only her father.

Since she is adopted, she doesn't have any real family to go to, except her brother. He is her biological brother, and they were adopted at the same time. They used to be close, but he sees her as a threat to the family, like she's trying to tear them apart. He doesn't trust her at all, and they no longer get along.

**TL;DR:** Friend was molested when she was a child, parents are trying very hard to cover everything up. She has no real family to go to. We need to know who we can talk to, who we can trust, and we have no evidence/proof.

She says when she gets back that nothing happened that i trust didn't because she isn't like that, also she seems to spend more time texting him than me.

She says that she isn't going to go back to him when we finish, because i asked her this several times saying i bet your going to back to your ex when you're through with me and she denys it.

Going in, and probably still, I would take her back in an instant. But she appeared very ready to move on. We held hands for most of the time and hugged and even shared a last kiss. She went on to tell me that I was everything she could have asked for in a boyfriend. Said I was the most attractive man she had ever met, said I treated her like a princess, and said that she may not find another like me. But that she needs to move on.

I accepted all this rather well, and we talked about how we still would be friends and how we still need each other in each other's lives, but just apart.

The obsession with fucking straight guys. The resounding denial of the existence of 100% heterosexuality, all while the OP claims that he (nor his friends) are attracted to women at all. The staggering amounts of objectification, justification, and denial.

I am a firm believer in basic human rights, so regardless of this incident I will continue to support gay rights... but I'm here to tell you, this does not help your cause.",-1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0

First I started off with [this](http://d3pr5r64n04s3o.cloudfront.net/002_Tut_WarmDesign/final.jpg) tutorial, it's not too close of a resemblance is it? Pretty much I copied the header and the navigation and then closed the tutorial cause I got bored and instead finished it up with the idea of turning it into my own site, changed the colors and whatnot and since I'm not a web designer I have no use for a portfolio or anything yet, maybe down the road. The site is mostly for myself and my friends, eventually I'll use it to host projects on there (I do some programming too). I also will tack it onto the top of my resume (oh and probably add a resume section) so potential employers or clients can visit the website, so while I'm not going for a professional site, it needs to be presentable in such an environment too.

Anyway, enough of the background. I know there's lots of problems with the site currently, it's a very rough mockup since I mostly just wanted to get an idea what I'm going for and then go knock it out in html/css/js. So I have more or less ignored getting things perfectly aligned, didn't bother to change portfolio to gallery, and I haven't really bothered with the typography atm, but I know that needs to be changed too. I am mostly wondering about my colors and background containers. The footer and header I think both look ok, but the background for body and the two containers backgrounds both look too flat to me and I'm not sure what to do about it. Not sure if I should change the color, add a gradient, or perhaps some kind of abstract effect. I've tried a few different things and this is the best I've come up with so far.

I am trying to get a handle on programming my own algorithms with javascript.  I thought that I might try my hand at Sudoku.  I figure that if you generate a random number and then check it against the row, column and box and it's not a duplicate, then write it, if not, generate a new random number.

It ""works"" in that it will generate the board but it is inefficient at best.  

I then thought that maybe there should be a pool of numbers to choose from (rather than generating random numbers, which will undoubtedly generate a lot of the same random numbers repeatedly).  This seems to work, but still isn't ideal.

Non-tl;dr:  **History:**  I don't know if this part is useful, but oh well.  Together for 5 years, and  maybe a year before this started up (right before I left for a year-long study abroad session), he commented on my hips+thighs, saying that they didn't ""blend together"" (---&gt;  aka, I have those panty bumps or whatever the fuck they are).  It bothered him.  Now I'm not a huge person by **any** means, but I have a larger derrière for my proportions, and this sort of coincides with my thighs and hips area.   Don't ask me why the fuck it bothers him, but holy shit did that piss me off.  That turned him off (I'm guessing?) and he got defensive over it.  Okay, so this took him **at least a year** to admit to that mistake and apologize.  I don't actually know if it bothers him still.

Current events:  No sex.  It's really only solo masturbation from both of us, or I get him off and vice versa.  I've asked him to please just fuck me.  I've asked him to please figure out **why** it is that he's so adverse to just having sex with me.  I think we've had this talk about 5 separate times now in the span of the 2 years since I've been back.  Each and every time, we'll have sex once... maybe twice (rare) in the span of about a month, and then it's back to whatever.  I just don't get it.  He lists his reasons in a wishy-washy way that he's nervous and some other reasons that I really don't remember because, shit, hell if even he knows.  Coupled with this, he doesn't really touch me besides hugs, he doesn't comment on anything about me, he's just overall sort of ""meh"" as all get out about me.  He's fine to masturbate, he's fine to get off on that porn thing, and he's fine to go to Hooters with his buddies or Show Me's or whatever the fuck places those are.

My family comes back from my graduation from Air Force BMT, right after Thanksgiving, and was welcomed by 3"" of sewage in the basement. My family was not the only house hold to get hit. A total of 3 homes were hit because of blockage in the sewage line. Our home, the home next to us and one down the street. 
The city came by and used a high pressure hose to unclog the sewage pipe and inadvertently did more damage to the house down the street. Because they brought on more damage to the house down the street the city will handle the disaster clean up bill. Meaning our house will not be covered along with the home next to us because it was damage only by the blockage. Anything that was in touch with the sewage was going to be thrown out. The sad part is that the basement is our storage room. From novelty items from trips to priceless wedding photos are gone. Back then in the 1st week of clean up, we were pretty devastated but were unstressed because we thought the city would cover us as well. Which is nice because the bill is well over $10k which doesn't include all of our priceless possession that I would say the grand total near $20k. We have taken off work to get things straighten out and with my mom who is on disability, income is harder than ever. We were just found out because it was a ""natural"" cause of a blockage in the sewer. They will not be covering our bill nor the home next to us.

171317,"My grandmother died Tuesday night. Don't feel like going into specifics, but she died from a massive heart attack in the hospital and it was completely unexpected since she was supposed to go home yesterday or today.

We were extremely close, having known her and lived with her ever since I was born. I'm 22, she was 84 when she died. 

Ever since my grandmother on my dad's side died from uterine cancer June 2009, I've been VERY afraid of losing someone nearer and dearer to me to the point where it was getting unhealthy, and well, it finally happened. I don't really know how I'm not in hysterics - I mean, I've cried, I yelled, I blamed everyone and everything, but I was assured that the blood clot that lead to her death really couldn't have been controlled. The tests came back fine because there was no evidence of blockage. What could they have found that with, anyway? I'm handling it better than my aunt anyway, who's prone to outbursts of hysterics and gets so anxious that she gags. My mom really hasn't shown much emotion, and neither has my dad, but he never really was the type of person to do that. He has been my rock throughout this ordeal so far. 

Anyway, my actual point is that my anxiety of losing someone else in the near future has not gone away. I feel like, in a couple of months, my aunt's or my dad's or my mom's health is just going to get worse, either by chance or as a reaction of my grandma's death. I tell them that I love them and want them to take care of themselves, but sometimes I can't help feeling like it's in one ear and out the other, especially w/ my parents. My biggest fear is abandonment, and I really cannot handle another unexpected loss where I'm feeling alone. My aunt REALLY feels alone even though I'm here; she says she's always made decisions with my grandmother (rather, my grandmother had the final say in just about everything she did) and can't do anything on her own now.

How viable of a strategy is it to tech towards burrow, have sufficient creep in the trap area (to enable faster zergling surround) lure the enemy to the trap area and have your burrowed zerglings behind them, fight their army with roaches and once he blinks back one or two shield deprived units, unburrow and pick off the weaker units as well as the forcefield generating units. It would probably force them to build an observer before they attempted to attack again but it would allow you to expand or attack if you wiped out their attack force.

Mind you I haven't played the game but I do watch streams and playbacks so I don't know how much it would cost to tech up to burrow or whether you can do it before they get an observer out.

Edit: Or if burrow is unfeasible, hide them off a ways and by the time they get into combat, its as good as a burrow? Then back that up with strategically placed overlords to provide a creep highway towards the trap.

172125,"As a Flash developer in my day job, I was a little disappointed at Flash being cut out of the App Store when it was announced.  I have a love-hate relationship with Flash, as I suspect many Flash developers do, so I wasn't too crushed.  Nor was I too happy at the prospect of a flood of crappy web games landing at the App Store.  But it did cut off an avenue of my own development, so I completely understood why there was such a furor over the decision.

Now I understand why Apple didn't want Flash games on the App Store.

The process of exporting an ActionScript 3 project to iOS is pretty straightforward, but not a single one of our games that I tried exporting to iOS did anything other than slow to an abysmal crawl when run on an iPad or iPhone.  Now, to date, all our games have been vector-based, which I figured would tax a mobile processor pretty hard, so I wasn't too surprised by this.  I spent many hours trying to tweak, optimize, and refactor things to try to eke some speed out of the engine, and many more hours reading stuff on the internet, trying to see what recommendations and best practices there were for going from Flash to iOS.  I eventually came to the conclusion that nothing short of a complete rewrite, from the ground up, using raster graphics instead of vector, would produce anything playable.  Our games, as written, could not be ported.

""Fine,"" I thought.  ""Let's try it with a bitmap-based game,"" and I busted out a technology demo with a bitmap tile-based walkaround engine, like for an old-school RPG.  It was really fast on the laptop and desktop, but when I exported it to iPad, again, it slowed to a crawl.  Not as bad as the vector-based games, but still unplayable.

Now, I'm sure there are caveats, protips, and disclaimers that people with more experience  can point me to for optimizing my Flash engine on iOS.  There are, after all, some Flash games on the App Store.  I'm sure there are some techniques that could bring things up to speed, and there were probably some things I was not doing in an absolutely optimal way.

But here's the thing.  If the feasible space for Flash on iOS is so small that it requires refactoring your project entirely, eschewing vector art, and putting on your guru hat to get even reasonable performance, practically no one's existing library will work without rewrites.  And if that's the case, *we might as well code it natively*.

With that in mind, I grabbed the latest version of Cocos2d-iphone, and got to work reproducing the walkaround engine I had made in Objective C.  In a few evenings, I got it working fullscreen on an iPad, with three new features: Bresenham line of sight calculations, animated water tiles, and a boundless Perlin Noise-based terrain map generated *on the fly*.

How did it perform?  *60 FPS, baby.*  I'd get a little hiccup when it generated a few more 64x64 blocks of terrain tiles, but other than that, smooth as silk.

Even better was the fact that it was *enjoyable* coding in Objective C instead of Flash.  I could export to the simulator and see my game running in seconds.  Exporting to the device didn't take much longer.  In comparison, it took a good 3-4 *minutes* to test a game out of Flash.  That alone made me far more productive.

So, my advice is this:  If you're a Flash developer eyeing the App Store, skip the Flash exporter entirely, bite the bullet, and learn Objective C.  It will save you a lot of time and frustration in the long run.  Seriously, if you can program a game in ActionScript 3, you can program a game in Cocos2D and Objective C.  If you need a leg up, get the how-to book from the [71 Squared guys](http://www.71squared.com/) or something, but don't be intimidated by the learning curve.  It's within your reach.

172474,"Please bear with me.  I will have questions, but I think some context would help.  It's going to look like a rant and I apologize.  But I'm simply beside myself and I don't know what to do.

I'm 35, in good health, employed, don't have money problems, have active interests that help get me by day to day, close friends that I see on a regular basis, and a somewhat healthy relationship with my parents and siblings.  In other words, I don't have any significant turmoil in my life that would be an indication of an emotionally unhealthy environment.

My wife is 35, healthy, employed, doesn't have money problems, is very active in her hobby (of which I support financially and otherwise), has very close friends that she sees often, and has a better relationship with her parents and siblings than I do.  Again, nothing to indicate that she's living in an unhealthy environment.

We've been married for almost fifteen years, have two daughters ages twelve and nine, both of whom are healthy, bright, and active girls.  So no major issues there.

We've both made sacrifices for each other over the years.  We've both worked hard on making a nice home, saving for vacations, going out, etc.  So I can't say that either of us is overly selfish in any way.

I've never cheated on her, never caroused, hell, I've never even flirted with another woman.  And to my knowledge, she's never done the same.  In fact, we have a pretty good sex life.  Better than most people I know as far as I can tell.

But here's the deal: Every time I want to do something; every time it's my idea, especially if it's something that doesn't involve her, I have a fight on my hands.  Or, she belittles it.  Or, she makes me feel stupid for even suggesting it.  Or, after a long drawn out fight, I finally get my way, but then if the slightest thing goes wrong, I'm constantly reminded of what a horrible mistake I made.  I have no say over how the household money is spent.  I get little input on how my girls are to be raised.  I have no say in what goes in to or how the house should look and whatnot.

Meanwhile, if she's wanted me to adjust some of my behavior for her benefit, I did.  She wanted me to play less video games.  I cut back significantly.  She wanted me to be on the computer less.  I stopped bringing my laptop home from work.  She wanted me to not watch as many sports.  So I cut back on the games I enjoyed.  She wanted me to start cooking, even though I fucking hate cooking with a red hot passion.  But I did any ways because that's what was needed.  She wanted me to cut back on any useless spending.  So I did, only to see her come walking into the house the next day with bags of new clothes for her and the girls.  It's all justified, of course.

I don't feel like a man in my own house.  And what set it off last night was her being pissed at me for going to have lunch with a couple of mutual friends.  I was able to duck out of work early to do this.  But she didn't care.  She didn't care that I was willing to drive another two hours just to pick her up and bring her back there to join us.

And she does this shit ALL THE TIME.

So what the hell do I do?  This has been going on for years.  I stand my ground, I'm told I'm an asshole.  But I popped last night.  I mean I raged.  I've never screamed like that at any one.  But I was screaming at her, at our friends.  And the whole time it felt awesome, but completely humiliating.

Fortunately the girls weren't around to see or here this.  I'm certain had they been, this would have probably never happened.

How do I start picking up the pieces?  How do I tell her that in spite of all of this shit, I still love, that I still want to have a happy life with her?  How do I start repairing the damage I did to every one around me?  How can I look her in the eye and tell her that although I love her, she's been a huge part of my unhappiness?

**EDIT** - It's been one hell of a weekend.  I promise to respond to all of your input individually seeing as how all of you took the time to help my sorry ass.

Long story short: After my meltdown Friday night, my wife and my girls stayed at our friend's.  Gratefully she didn't drag her family into it.  My best friend talked me down from the ledge.  He helped me realize that I need help.  And I'm going to get that.  My wife loves me.  She didn't know.  She didn't know how unhappy I am.  And that's she absolutely terrified of losing me.  My girls have no idea what happened.

We've agreed to some things.  First, I'm going to write down what's been going through my head all of these years.  It's clear that something disconnects when I try to speak and it all comes out wrong.  We're going to go to counseling together and separate.  She acknowledges that she has a problem communicating, too.

I still love my wife.  But I have to get back to wanting what I have.  What I have with her.  With my girls.  With my life in general.  And I don't.  I've spent years telling myself that I have every reason to be happy.  But I'm not.  It's not just her.

172690,"Here's a list of my opinions and an arbitrary rating of each of the maps shipped with both MW2 and BlOps, with references to CoD4 maps. 

It's all subject to preference although I've tried to remain objective in most cases. High ratings are given for innovation, balance, variance of sight lines, and empahsis on variance in tactics of play. 

I'm at home with my xbox at university, with exams to study for, so such a procrastination is due to severe CoD withdrawal symptoms :)

My thoughts:

**MW2**

* **Afghan** - excellent all round map based around perimeter play, was better for some objectives more than others, and could prove quite campy, but overall had enough varied cover points and counter points to keep it interesting, 8/10

* **Derail** - far too big, too much time spent traversing the map, only really suited to ground war, SnD became a game of who had the biggest balls to run the furthest, all other game types became a cluster fuck for the centre house. Big =/= better, 3/10

* **Estate** - a fight for the centre house in most game types, if you controlled this you controlled the game, thus justifying danger close for some people. Poor overall design in my opinion, it looked pretty, but  was ultimately a poor map 4/10

* **Favela** - excellent mix of interesting sight lines, roof top battles, and clever short cuts, one of MW2s best offerings, never got bored of it in most game types 8/10

 * **Highrise** - the perfect CoD map, equal peggings, slightly ruinged by OP spawn sniping, which I'm sure was fun for some. How can you dislike it? Perhaps a little too symmetrical? Nah this is a classic in even the FPS genre overall, 9/10

* **Invasion** - standard CoD gridded map affair, three main routes with interlinking buildings, see Crash, Strike, or District from CoD4. If it aint broke... 6/10

* **Karachi** – it sounded like a vaginal euphemism, but was actually a well designed map that had few routes through the centre but enough cover of each one that no one vantage point was imperious. The satellite dish was where control could be found, and it only had two and a half routes to it. A good map but not a great one 6/10 

* **Quarry** – dominated by the high ground towards one corner of the map with three viable routes up to that area all with sloped ground making anybody a sitting duck, all TDMs became a struggle to control this area, with the buildings surrounding it having too great a vantage points, not a good design imo. Although it was a more enjoyable affair with other game types 5/10

* **Rundown** - a map not suited to many game types, B dom was a killzone, and FFA was a boosters paradise. It could have been massively improved with romoval of one eighth of its overall area getting rid of the garage and the back house. Not a fun map, too stand offish over the bridge heads, without much relief - 5/10

* **Rust**- like shipment only shit. Mainly due to the towering obstruction in the centre being too overwhelming, fundamental map design failure 2/10

* **Scrapyard** - standard map four perimeter buildings and small complex in centre, good for some game modes, terrible for others, nothing special 5/10

* **Terminal** - I'm sure everyone that played this agrees, it's a map of beauty, such an awesome setting, and a good blend of gun fight scenarios makes this my favourite and probably that of many others 10/10

* **Underpass** - meh see Invasion, yet rainy and depressing 5/10
  
* **Wasteland** - one of the most hot/cold maps ever, when doing well you love it when doing poorly you hate it. Such large sight lines, yet segmented with the cluster fuck centre. It was certainly interesting, if like me you figured out how to do well with a scar for example, you could make an entire lobby your collective bitch on this map. I'll give it a high rating for innovation, and unique layout, with realistic battleground feel 8/10

* **Sub Base** - standard affair, good for objective games, ruined by tac insertion boosting on FFA but so were many other maps, not much to say. Although it did provide building areas that managed not to create one superior location to camp in, so technically its design must be rather good. 7/10

* **Skidrow** - an excellent all round map, long corridors with vantage points made for interesting team based stand offs, leading to eventual flanking and rape, my personal favourite from this game, due to a clutch I once had in SnD ""this one time I had a clutch..."" 8/10

-----------------------------------------

**BlOps**


* **Array** – urghghgghgghhhhhhh, since I’ve actually gotten good at this map, I no longer wish cancerous aids upon its designer, perhaps just a violent cough. It’s piss poor map design in my opinion. The round house is far, far too dominant. Saying that: since I now control that house, without fail, I can confidently get a randy savage K/D on it. But do I have fun doing this? No. I’ll give it a 4 because in some game types it redeems it self; and reminds me of the fourth layer from Inception, and that is a good film... 4/10

* **Cracked** - Standard CoD grid affair, by grid let me clarify, that I mean a 3 by 3 sequential building situation, as seen in every CoD since the good old pre sprinting CoDs. 5/10

* **Crisis** - a grower, you immediately despise it because of its diarrhoea like textures; and your intital insistence on fighting in the concrete underbelly. Big mistake, fight for top control of sand bags and the house, and you’ll start to warm to this map, not a bad map by any means. The amount of secret jump short cuts, makes it a good objective map also. 7/10 

* **Firing Range** - Imo a brilliant map, without boasting or quoting my stats. I can tell you that (boasts about stats*) I am a gang of well hung gang rapists on this map. If you aren’t; I highly suggest the second floor of the side house, with a motion sensor a flak jacket and a chopper gunner, it’s the only map I camp in, much hate mail!  The actual design I feel is pretty solid, it manages to be a tiny map, yet have complex layers and routes, due to a clever use of a cliff and an invisible wall by the ‘ravine’. Splitting the map in two. Ever seen it not voted for? Exactly 9/10

* **Grid** – not a fan really, it’s a roughly symmetrical map, but with one building's second floor being utterly superior to the other's. This leads to, far too much fighting for this one building. Not a fan. 4/10

* **Hanoi** - uruggghghg nauseatingly bad map, its irregular symmetry, or lack thereof; and overly campy construction, ensure you won’t enjoy it. I actually spend time just looking at the gallows in one of its two centres hoping to end it all. 2/10

* **Havana** - excellent all round map, a perfect CoD affair, with an overall s shape, harking back to Crossfire. How can you not like it? Only misses out on being a 10, due lack of innovation 8/10

* **Jungle** – innovative scenario and layout, but with the usual three main routes. All routes have their own segmented compartmentalised firing zones making it full of enjoyable little skirmishes. Its good for close quarters and long range, I believe the only reason it isn’t a 10 is because it’s utterly unconvincing as a jungle, and an excellent example of Treyarch’s poor graphics textures 9/10

* **Launch** - great all round map very similar to Ambush in CoD4 in that the centre ground is higher than the two spawn sides, with a simlar mesh of interlocking cover points over on each side. Not a bad map by any means, although the Soyez rocket area is a little under ulitlised in death match modes. Leading to lob-sided fighting.  7/10

* **Nuketown** – underachieving son of Shipment, a good little map, if you’re in an organised team that understand the idea of not flipping a spawn it can be enjoyable; and FFA spawn traps are ^_^ delicious… for me mwhahaha. Fast and frenzied like fucking on cocaine 8/10

* **Radiation** - a great map, seriously its average, but a door, that you can open and close making objectives harder to take? with opposing switches, why hasn’t this been done before? Genius stuff. It’d be good to average otherwise, but I’ll give this a solid 9/10

* **Summit** – Brilliant map, ruined by spawn issues. I always think its array in the lobby for some reason then am pleasantly surprised when it comes up. It has balanced spawn areas, in terms of cover etc, with interesting fire fights in the centre, with just the right amount of cover causing a two levelled battle ground. Not too shabby 7/10

* **Villa** – Not the best map I’ve ever seen…. I believe it rewards a camping mentality, especially in big team modes, too many choke points overwatched from windows, with not enough routes to the camping areas. For example the window above ‘bar’ with only one staircase up to it. Or the massive balcony with only two door ways. C- must try harder 5/10 

* **WMD** – people seem to love this map, although I’ve yet to find a way to enjoy it, it seems too constipated, if that makes any sense, I get frustrated on it and lose my team too easily and end up being multi-fucked. I’m sure many others like it, however, based on  my friends and this subreddit, so I’ll faithfully give it a 6/10

------------------------------------------------------

**Results:**

MW2 16 maps, 98/160, average score 6.1

BlOps 14 maps, 90/140, average score 6.43

**Conclusion:** I need either a girlfriend, or to start studying. 
Haha no..

In conclusion, maps of either game are of a very similar quality, with levels displaying similar patterns of design.  The occasional innovative variation crops up, which can lead to interesting maps like Jungle or travesties like Hanoi.

It’s the gameplay of either game that make the difference if you played with the damage and gun recoil of MW2 on BlOps maps you’d have an entirely different experience. Be that to your personal preference or not.

173188,"Maybe I'm just oversensitive to the sensationalist media when it comes to the weather, but I'm starting to think there may be cause for real concern.  I'm sure the media using terms like ""snowmageddon"" and ""snowacalypse"" don't help matters, but I like to think I'm intelligent enough to observe what's happening and come to my own conclusions...  Here's what's concerning me:

1.  An increased frequency in unusually low temperatures across the United States, and across much of Europe during the winter months.  

2.  Southeastern United States getting a lot more winter activity (snow, sleet, freezing rain), while the Northeast seems to be having milder winters.

3.  Unusually active tornado seasons.

4.  Unusually active hurricane seasons.

5.  I admit I pay less attention to what's going on outside of the United States, but I do believe I hear more about snow in Europe these days than I used to.  Hearing things like ""Iraq gets first snowfall on record"" can be cause for alarm.

6.  Speaking of which, you hear these things on an almost regular basis now: record-breaking highs and lows, record-breaking snowfalls, record-breaking droughts, record-breaking rainfalls.  I keep hearing people saying, in regard to some weather occurrence (on the news, or in person): ""I've never seen anything like this.""

I do realize that weather cycles have very long periods, and what seems to be unusual could just be a natural progression of a cycle.  But the rapidity and severity of these changes seems, to a mere mortal human, at least unusual if not alarming.

Is anyone else noticing these things?  Is there a pattern to all of this, perhaps correlating across multiple disciplines (astronomy and meteorology, for example)?  

Finally, if this is something to attribute to the current solar minimum, what will the upcoming solar max bring?  Someone out there in the hivemind must have an educated idea.

Today I went to buy vouchers for some family members to get a 'pedicure' from a place where you put your feet in a fish tank and the fish nibble away at the dead skin.  Apparently it's quite a nice experience.

On my way to buy them I passed a number of homeless people.  It's really cold out just now (-5C during the day) so I had the bright idea of giving the vouchers to some of them and instead giving my family members a photo of the person that their voucher went to.

I got a little nervous about how to actually go about doing this, though, and decided to do it in the morning instead.

174107,"I've yet to find a way to avoid watching mediocre series. I have several approaches, but none seem too reliable. One obvious approach is to look at ratings. The problem with this is that no matter where I go, ratings are highly biased in favor of new trendy shows. Using this method exclusively would rule out many classics which are, in my humble opinion, actually pretty damn good. Also, it seems the ratings have a heavy bias towards moe, or other otaku oriented anime. I mean, sure, k-on had quite a few redeeming qualities, but it never really struck me the way it did for other anime fans. 

Another approach would be to read reviews. I would think that the more eloquent a review, the more I would trust it, since it seems like the reviewer knows his stuff. I just finished *Hale+Guu*, and really didn't think too greatly of it. The thing is, I started the series after reading extremely eloquent reviews praising it to the heavens. I've found that mediocre comedy and pointlessly emotional melodrama seem to evoke really well written reviews. I'm finding more and more that I can't trust reviews.

Now, a third approach is to find a reviewer that you generally agree with, and follow any anime that he's rated highly. This usually works, but lots of times s/he will inexplicably love something that isn't that great. Maybe it's nostalgia, maybe it somehow struck a nerve that I don't have, who knows. 

Another technique that I've tried is just following a director. This isn't perfect, but it works reasonably well. I have pretty good chances with Miyazaki, Anno, Kon or Shinbou. However, the director doesn't always write the stories, so all this guarantees me is good direction.

I've found that one of the most successful techniques to me recently is to simply look at artwork and the description. I've found anime this way that I never would have checked out based on ratings, reviews, or favorite reviewers. For example, I loved the crud out of *Dance in the Vampire Bund*, which has abysmal ratings, and all of my favorite reviewers dislike it. 

So, does anyone else have any tips for improving my game? How do you find good anime?

175129,"Hi reddit! Happy Saturday.

I got forwarded an interesting email about Thomas Jefferson's accomplishments that ended on a troubling ""Founding Fathers/Christian Nation"" note. My mom is still quite progressive, and what followed was a dialogue on Jefferson's Deism and the idea of God's involvement/disinvolvement in evolution/creation. 

Anyhoo. No more ado. Enjoy. But also please critique this if you could!


&gt;True!
&gt;
I realised that the way I phrased it was odd. I meant the Deism comment to highlight a fact that is often either willfully ignored or misunderstood by bible belters calling him a ""patriot"" or founding father in a Christian Nation.
&gt;
&gt;I conceive intelligent design to be an apt description, but have also been given this thought:
If you asked a penguin, or a jellyfish for that matter, how the world was created. They might observe man as we observe the jellyfish, and say that on the seventh day, God finally created the jellyfish.
The more we learn about other species and life forms (whales especially), the more we begin to understand that they all possess incredible aptitudes for learning and thought. I believe that intelligent design extends beyond human life, and includes the mechanism of macroevolution. God is omnipresent in time as well, and never leaves our side, however we may be. But I have a genuine problem when humans consider themselves so powerful and exceptional in God's eyes that they regard themselves as a higher form of life than:
&gt;1)animals
&gt;2)God's ecosystems
&gt;3)other humans.
&gt;
&gt;The ego on man is, in my opinion, the most difficult thing to overcome. Even I squish ants. We like to consider other animals as inferior because ""where are their skyscrapers and automobiles?"" I believe that because other species live in harmony with others and give them space, with no ownership through pesticides, etc. they are rather superior things.
&gt;
&gt;We have told ourselves and told ourselves that we were God's ultimate triumph. This may be so, but need to recognize our part in the world, and that God created everything as perfectly as he did us. Even the mechanisms of adaptation that have preserved life on earth from fragile beginnings across several violent ice ages.
&gt;
&gt;But that might be just me.
&gt;Love you!

175378,"Sorry for the attention whore title. But now that you are here, the meat:

[This little thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/enwp5/girlfriend_wants_to_do_burlesque_and_i_feel/c19jcl6) has me seething at the moment. It's from **Relationship Advice** where a guy is uncomfortable with his girlfriend performing burlesque. Some of the reactions to this poor chap are  outrageous. Accusing him of being a prude and telling him to stuff his feelings in a box and throw them away? Come on.

In a relationship, I don't consider my girlfriend my property or believe I have some sanctimonious right to tell her what to do. However, I do believe that a relationship is exclusive because both partners mutually choose to hold something for each other alone. What that specifically entails is for the couple themselves to decide.

Some couples allow each other to sleep around. Some aren't even ok with flirting with other people. How does expecting either of those make someone a bad person? It's just about finding someone like minded and not cheating on the covenant you enter. If you can't live up to the covenant, you always have the option to leave and find someone more in line with your tastes.

I'm sick of people on Reddit saying stuff that goes: ""Jeez man, you are so insecure! Be proud she gets other guy's attention"" or ""Why don't you lock her up at home then you evil bastard?"" I date women **I** think are attractive. I don't give two shits about what other people think about my girl, positive or negative. I'm comfortable with a lot but I hold my SO to same standards I hold myself and I'm upfront about what those are. 

I'm not ok with my girlfriend flirting with other guys. I don't think women who do this are evil/skanky/bored/whatever. It's just that I think flirting is something I'd like to reserve for the special woman in my life and I'd like her to do the same. It's just one more way for her to know that she's got something that nobody in the world will get. Does that make me old-timey and sentimental? Sure if you want to call it that. Does that make me a bad person? I don't think so. I'm clear about my needs in a relationship and appreciate women who are the same way. I've dated women who weren't comfortable with holding back the flirting. I'm comfortable enough not to fault them for that and actually appreciate the fact that they were upfront with their own choices.

So what I'm saying is: I can't apply my standards to the rest of you and I don't expect to. What I can do is tell poor chaps like the OP in the R_A thread that he isn't some unreasonable asshole. On the same token, don't be dicks and throw around sanctimonious negative judgements onto your fellow Redditors. (Now obviously I will see more than a few trolls doing just that in this thread.) It's unfair and kind of irritating.

Thank you for listening. Good night and good luck.


tl;dr: Relationships are about two people who lay down a set of mutual expectations. Don't be sanctimonious about people who have different expectations than yours.

EDIT: Just to be clear I'd rather not talk about the specific R_A burlesque issue in this thread. If you have opinions on that, please go over to that thread.

Didn't see an opt out, and was prepared to opt-out myself, but the fact was they had the other line to the left which just had the metal detector operational, which you could just use instead of the other line, though they were shuttling people through the line with the scanner.

That said, I did see one woman protest and was allowed to go through the other line without the scanner. Yay Liberty! But it was all ages, sizes, shapes, sexes that were going through the other, getting scanned.

I mean, for example: Everyone accuses Hamas of using human shields.  But did you know, independent human rights groups have had a hard time finding any evidence to support this?  The sole source of these accusations is the IDF and their characteristically blurry, short, out of context videos.  On the other hand, the goldstone report (among other independent investigations) have found ample evidence to prove that Israeli soldiers have repeatedly used palestinians (sometimes even palestinian children) as human shields.

Another example: Everyone decrys Hamas for kidnapping Gilad Shalit.  But did you know, that according to Defence for Children International, Israel currently has several hundred palestinian children in custody.  And that there's evidence that many of them have been subject to beatings and other torture?

I don't like either group.  But thus far I've seen no evidence that Israel is in any way better than Hamas and Hezbollah.  I mean, for every accusation lobbied against them, you can find an equally or more damning (and better proven) accusation to place against Israel.  They directly target civilians?

176455,"So....I almost don't know where to start.

We have been married for 2 years.  I've known him for 6.

I feel frustrated almost every moment of every day.  I feel like I may have made a huge mistake by marrying him.  I feel ZERO emotional attachment to him.  I almost feel like I never had any attachment to him.

I guess liked him in the beginning (it seems like I can barely remember that now).  He was really nice.  He still is nice in some ways.  He'll buy things for me or think of me before himself sometimes - but he verbally abuses me 20 or 30 times a day.  

When I eat, he stares at me and makes smacking noises with his mouth while staring into my eyes in a challenging way (I'm not overweight).  He's just irritated by sound.  He does it to be rude when I eat for some reason.  I try to be so careful about making sound because I don't want to get into it - but there's no way to eat a chip (or certain foods) quietly.  I try, but I can't.  He is rude to me anyway.

Or, he turns the car stereo up where it hurts my ears if he's unhappy with what I'm saying.  Or, he turns the radio when my favorite song is on - this is only maybe once a day when I tell him I love a song.  He'll turn it on purpose.

Or maybe I'm eating something he doesn't even like - he'll grab my plate and eat it while looking at me just to prove that he can.

When we go somewhere in the car I only play on my iphone to avoid talking to him.  If I speak to him, he'll be nothing but rude.  I do anything in his presence to avoid dealing with him.  This has also made me an avid Redditor.

I basically spend my life trying to avoid him.  There are not good times.  We didn't once have great times that I miss, but things went bad.  I think I misinterpreted what I thought were good times.  They weren't.

I don't want to be with him (I think) for a few reasons I've written here and many, many that I don't have time to write about.

We had such a beautiful wedding.  It was overseas.  On a beach.  People told us it was the most beautiful wedding they'd ever seen.  I look at our pictures and I can't believe the life I have now.  I can't believe I want to end what looks like (but isn't) a fairy tale.

My family is very religious (I'm not particularly), but I will be the only one on either side of my family tree to divorce.  Plus, this was not my plan for my life.

He knows how unhappy I am.  I threaten to divorced him at least 3-4 times a week.  I guess he thinks I won't do it.  I ask him to please change so I don't have to leave him...... but he tells me to leave if I want - he'll find someone else.  He knows I will too.  We're both not worried about finding other people.  But, strangely - he is more opposed to the idea of divorce than I am.  He'll break down and cry and tell me he doesn't want one - and I tell him to change or it will happen...... but he never changes.  Every day is more of the same.  I feel like I should go now.  He's had plenty of warning (for months and months) and there is no difference.

He admits he's rude to me.  He apologizes that moment, but it doesn't matter because he does the same thing the next day.  

OK....counseling.  I guess I should have gone before, but I have a counseling background.  I have been a counselor for abused children.  Counselors try to work things out.  I'm not sure if I even want to try.  I'm not sure if this relationship is worth it.

Even if lots of it is fixed, I still feel nothing - literally nothing in common with him.  I'm not sure I even want to bother with it.

Help!!!  I honestly want out, but I'm so afraid of it.  We live overseas.  I'm an ocean away from friends or family.  I think I could be happier elsewhere, but getting a divorce seems so daunting and scary to me.  I don't know anyone who has.  It wasn't my plan for my life.

EDIT:  I just feel lost.  I think I should probably get out, but I don't know how to emotionally and physically go about doing it.  Plus, of course, I still do love him on some level - I think he's just not best for my life.  I would love to hear from any other Redditor and how they've dealt with divorce.

Unfortunately, the show was never released on DVD. I've also checked abc.com, iTunes, Netflix streaming, hulu, etc. -- no dice.

The neighborhood he lives in, Capital Hill, it's a really cool neighborhood with a lot of arts and culture and a pretty prominent nightlife to say the least.

I'm from a small town on the eastern side of Washington State, which I would say tends to lean heavily towards the conservative side of things.  Now in no way homophobic, at all, my family is fairly liberal and I am really tolerant and accepting of all lifestyles, I really mean that.

I know that people should accept you for who you are, but in the world of dating, I know that first impressions make a big difference.  If the roles were reversed, I think that I'd want a friend to pull me aside and let me know.

Fixes I have tried-

-Tried 3 different video card driver versions

-I have no voice input

-Hardware acceleration from full to basic using dxdiag

-Updated SB audigy drivers (On-board soundcard was disabled with no drivers installed)

-After Audigy update failed to help, I disabled and removed it. Then I installed the onboard sound card drivers and enabled it. It works fine with every other game.

-Turned off Data Execution Prevention for BF:BC2

-Changed in-game settings including:

high, medium, low textures

HSAO on/off

Bloom on/off

anisotropic filtering and MSAA 1x/off

Headphone quality sound/HiFi

VOIP on/off

Changed FOV 55 to 65 for 1440 x 900 res

-Disabled Daemon Tools before launch, along with every other non-essential program

-Updated punkbuster manually

178588,"For me: Yes.  (**Edit**: And I think this is the way forward. Most problems caused by religion are caused by strict adherence to the scriptures, and most organized religions rely on them to give them power over the people by putting 'scriptural scholars' behind the altar. I think if we can take the scriptures off their pedestals we can teach our children wholesome spirituality without bigotry and segregation, and religious people's experience of their faith will be upgraded, not diminished.)

In order for me to believe in unconditional love and mercy as being characteristics of our Creator, I've concluded that the scriptures (Torah, Bible, Koran, Etc.) are NOT written by Him/Her. Instead, I've utilized my free will to decide to rely on the tools I've been given: Intellect, Intuition, my Conscious and Emotion, among others, to get me as close to the truth as possible, to enable me to try to make the best decisions possible. Surely I'll continue to make mistakes along the way, but I'll learn, and best of all, I'm NOT afraid I won't make it to heaven, as I'm confident ALL that have been created (against their free will) by the Creator will end up in the same heaven as the rest of us. 
Therefore, I also do not have any hatred towards what others call 'sinners', and I don't end debates with them by saying: ""well you're going to hell, I hope you enjoy it- Ha!""

That's just not how the Creator I believe in rolls.

TL;DR: I believe in ""God"", but I also believe in False Religions and I think it's important for religious/spiritual people to trust their own intuition and judgments, rather than blindly follow some spiteful books.

If you believe in God, do you think he'll think badly of you if you decide to take the scriptures with a grain of salt? If no, why not jump ship?",-1,-1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I ran an update that consisted of many.

It took about an hour and a half to go through all of it and some of them I didn't know what they were and I was asked a bunch of Yes or No questions. The ones I didn't know I said no to. Now I don't know too much about linux so obviously I messed something up. When all of the updates were done the only change that was very noticeable was that the desktop gui turned into a lower quality picture. So I restarted the VPS and now when I run the command ""tightvncserver -geometry 800x600"" in the console to start my VNC server I don't get any errors, but it appears to not load at all. When I watch the ram I noticed two things. Just rebooting the VPS the ram stays at 2mb normally a full reboot would end up at around 15mb. And second when the VNC server runs normally the ram would be around 350 to 450mbs now it's just staying at 9mbs and not moving.

If you're curious about *why*, well, long-term it's all about time. I really put a fair amount of time and thought into what I write. I enjoy it, and I think I've improved valuable skills, but it also keeps me from reading, playing video games, doing homework, etc. I think it's probably easier for me to take a break and focus on other things and come back than try to really finesse how much time to put in each day.

And I like to start fresh, not have old mistakes to deal with. It's the beautiful thing about the Internet: the ability to resurface again as a new being. Also, I've got something of a self-destructive streak, and this helps to satisfy that without doing anything too serious.

Short-term, well, I've had a few more serious arguments here recently than I usually do. But none of them are too serious; none of them caused me to do this. It was already planned and decided on. The timing was certainly encouraged by my local meetup subreddit's reaction to a recent attempt to organize a stoner meetup, but that just meant I wanted to get out of here a few days before I otherwise would have.

Anyhow, if you've read this far, I want you to know I sincerely appreciate it. Being able to speak my mind and be heard is pretty rare for me, especially because I speak a lot more than people want to read/listen. It's the great thing about Reddit; it's the addictive thing, and it's what makes this so personal to me at times.

tl;dr: I'm deleting my account to wander away for a spell. I'll be back again sometime, probably not for at least a month, hopefully for rather longer. But even if there were nothing else, I wouldn't be able to stay away from my favorite 40,000 some ganja buddies forever.

180004,"First off I wanna say that I'm not a smoker myself; I've done it before and decided it wasn't my thing. That being said, I'm very pro-cannabis and pro-legalization and all of that stuff. Almost all of my friends are avid smokers, and I personally have never felt pressured by any of them to smoke against my better judgement. I lurk trees a lot (I've posted once or twice) and I'm always really impressed by how level-headed and chill the community is.

What I'd like to ask about about is your views on people who choose to abstain entirely from smoking; who never try it and never intend to. The reason I'm asking is because of [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/eo6km/reddit_is_so_diverse_i_had_this_idea/c19lufe) comment thread. A few people are calling this kid out because he says that he's never tried cannabis and that it's not his thing. They're saying that he couldn't possibly know it's not his thing unless he's tried it... and I think that's kind of a messed up thing to say. If he wants to smoke, that's awesome; if he doesn't want to, that's awesome too. I feel like some of these comments are challenging that, and almost pressuring him to smoke or implying that he's ignorant if he doesn't smoke. Now, if he were trying to tell other people they shouldn't smoke that'd be another story, but if it's just his personal decision, I think people should respect that.

One thing I'd like to clarify is that I'm not saying that someone can necessarily predict whether or not they'd enjoy being high without trying it first, but rather that someone can absolutely decide they don't ever want to get high without having previously been high, and that no one should tell them their decision is wrong or closed-minded.

So do you guys think that someone has to try pot before they can say it's not their thing? Do you think it's okay to just decide to never do it, or would you say that's ignorant or presumptuous? I'm really interested to get your feedback on this and hopefully get a feel for the overall opinion of the community.

180016,"So I am visiting my brother who lives in Seattle, WA. The neighborhood he lives in, Capital Hill, it's a really cool neighborhood with a lot of arts and culture and a pretty cool  bar scene. Seattle has a fairly substantial gay populations, and according to wikipedia Capital Hill is the center of LGBT lifestyle in the city (referring collectively to lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people). I'm from a small town on the eastern side of Washington State, which  tends to lean heavily towards the conservative side of things. Now in no way homophobic, at all, my family is fairly liberal and I am really tolerant and accepting of all lifestyles, I really mean that. With that said, I was walking home back to my brothers apartment from the bars, it was around 2:45 I believe, and right in front of his building on a fairly lit sidewalk were two gentleman, one standing, and one on his knees performing the lovely art of fellatio  on the other. No one else was on the street, I just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time I guess. I was in complete shock, one of them yelled ""hey, are you some kind of a cop?"" I just muttered ""nope"", kept my head down and walked quickly towards his apartment. So I was wondering, has anyone seen anything remotely close to something this bizarre in a big city? I'm not asking if public oral sex is a common thing to come across, I doubt that it is, but I guess what I'm asking is this something that wouldn't surprise people if they did come across it having lived in a liberal city like Seattle.

180022,"Note: Made a throwaway so I could reveal my age without it being tied to my account. Also, read the whole thing before replying, or just read the tl;dr.

I'm a 16 year old male, she is a 16 year old female.

Backstory: I seen her in the hallway a few times in 9th grade (May 2009, we were both 14 then and our birthdays are in August). Talked to a female friend from another city, she encouraged me to talk to her. I was/am nervous in social situations, especially with girls I find attractive.

One day I walked up to her and started a conversation. Got her number and called her that night. We talked a few more times every few days on the phone and through Myspace.

She asked me to go with her to Warped Tour in July, not a fan of her music be agreed nonetheless. I was pretty awkward the whole time. As in, we were in a crowd of people jumping and screaming, including her, and I just stood there. My back made me very miserable that day as we stood for about 9 hours straight and I wore loose shoes. Getting a little off track here with my memories...

We kept in contact throughout the summer.

When school started up (In September. 10th graders now, USA, btw) we were in the same class. I was still nervous around and her and choose a seat one away from her (diagram: my seat |_| empty seat between us |_| her seat |_|). She got up and said, ""well I want to sit next to you,"" and moved over to the empty seat.

At this point I was very much so (and thought she was) interested into taking our friendship and turning it into a relationship.

We kept talking daily. Hanging out almost every other weekend.

In October, I decided to make a move, whether it was for better or worse because I was becoming irritated at my own fear of rejection.

We were coming back from a drive in movie (in which we shared a blanket between us. not a needed part of the story, but whatever) and were in her mom's van.

I said to her, after much overthinking, ""Hey let's try something out."" She says ""Ok."" I take her hand and hold it in mine. Note: It was about 10pm and we were in the last row of seats where it was impossible for her mom to see us. I say, ""Do you like holding hands?"" She nods and smiles and then says, ""Yeah."" We hold hands for another minute or so, then mutually stop.

I find out over the course of a few days, that she told a friend of her's that I know but didn't care for, that I was creepy for holding her hand. I was stricken by this, after seeing her positive reaction. 

On the bus home I see her friend, the one I didn't care for. He says ""[Her] doesn't like you [Me]. She thinks you are a weird loser.""

Not gonna lie; I secretly cried into my hoody as if I were sleeping.

Thinking she didn't like me at all, I did my best to ignore her completely, fearing she would rub the pain in more. (Obviously I didn't think this through, and you know, just *talked* to her. But we all make mistakes.)

After a few days she apparently catches wind of me ignoring her, and comes up to me in class and says ""I want to be your friend still.""

Now I was thinking I was 100% I was friendzoned, hard, after being a pussy and not just asking her out. (This is what I seriously thought then. Still didn't just *talk* to her.)

Up until December we were still talking regularly at school, not on the phone or over the internet.

The anger inside me from me thinking I was friendzoned built up (Nope. Still didn't talk to her about any of my feelings) was building amazingly high. One day before school I texted her ""I really want to talk to you about something that has been bugging me."" Her reply ""You might as well not even talk to me today then, I'm not talking about anything in school."" I fucking lost it there. ""What the fuck ever. I'm not your little bitch that you can just leash around and control (Yeah, I regret all of this), and beckon whenever you feel like it."" She says ""Right. Because *that's* what I was doing. Whatever though."" I replied ""Right.""

And that was that.

I never talked to her in school or any other medium again. Signed up for an online school a week or two before. Helped her sign up too. I was gone within that week.

We had to go to state testing in April of this year. I knew she would be there since she signed up for the school too. I looked at her, and she looked back. After that, we both just kept our heads down. I was going to talk to her on the last test day and try to salvage this broken mess we made. She sat on the bench outside waiting for her mom. I look at her, and she looks up, I stop for a moment as if I was trying to get my tongue back. Then I just walk across the street.

And that's it. Thanks for reading.

My question I would like advice on is: Should I try to talk to her again? I really want to make up for everything I said, but I know I am not the only one to blame here, we both did wrong. I still yearn for her friendship though. Amazingly sweet girl. If I shouldn't try to talk to her, why?

One last note: Please do not belittle my problem because of my age. I get that I over think things, and I shouldn't worry because we be friends forever. But screw all that. I want to be her friend again, but only if she wants to be mine, obviously. I know you can't answer if she does because there is no way for any of us to know, but I am rambling again. I will answer any questions you need to make a better mental picture of the situation as long as it doesn't disclose us or our location.  



tl;dr I started talking to a girl. Held her hand. Thought she friendzoned me for not asking her out. We start talking again. My anger builds and I lash out at her and give her the cold shoulder for 8 months. I regret this, and want to be her friend (I don't care about a ""relationship"" with her anymore. If it happens, hell yeah). Please don't brush off my problems because of my age.

I'm new at this modding thing, but I was hoping for the most simple of explanations for me here.
I'm trying to put this mod in new vegas: http://newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=35061
I got one to work, (this one: http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=34811) but that was because it was easy to just extract one file in to the data folder.
with the radio one above, there are multiple files and there is a folder called data. if i extract that into the data file for the game, it does nothing (i don't see it on the data files pop up to check it at the front).
is there something i need to do differently since the set up of the mod is not just one script file?

You have immediate access to Google, so unless your source is either classified or unpublished, you should be fine.

181969,"There is this convenient store (a *depanneur* as we call them in Quebec) right around the corner from where I live. It is held by a family of Indian immigrants. One of them, a beautiful girl, usually works at the cash at nights. She barely speaks English and doesn't speak French at all. Or so I thought.

I go there very often to buy cigarettes, beer or milk. Over the last few months, I've come to know her two brothers. They are very nice people. They make you feel that you are important to them. It's like they know when you feel like chatting, or if you just woke up and just want in and out as fast as possible.

Back to the girl. She seems like a very shy girl. She tilts her head down a bit when I'm alone with her. Two weeks ago, I went there with one of my friends and as soon as we came out, he told me that she obviously was into me. I didn't really realize it before. I just thought she was just shy around men or uncomfortable because of her cultural background.

That girl is simply beautiful and the idea of dating her made it's way into my head, even though I thought this would be impossible. Yesterday morning, I decided I would talk a bit with one of her older brothers to see what he thought about the idea.

Well, at first he was completely silent. He just looked at me frowning. I said that maybe it wasn't a good idea after all and was about to leave when he said ""Wait... Let me talk to you about something.""

He went on about the story of his family. How his parents died a couple of years ago. How he, his brother and his wife came to Quebec 6 years ago. How he and his brother adopted the Quebec lifestyle. How they were able to bring their little sister (the beautiful girl) one year ago after 5 years of separation. And on and on. Fascinating story!

It turns out that the sister is taking classes in a French university. She speaks a little French but is shy to do it. She complains that she is living a boring life, doesn't have any friends, and is kind of lost around here. He told me that me hanging out with her would be a very good thing for her, but that it was against their religion and culture. But at the same time, he and his brothers don't have much time to spend trying to to cheer her up and make her meet an Indian man in Montreal.

Then, the frown came back on his face. ""Are you a good man?"" I said ""Yes, of course. Let's put it this way. If I go out with your sister, all we will do is hang out and have fun. We will all be clear about it from the beginning. I will not try to have sex with her, or even kiss her. She will practice her French and meet interesting people. And everyone I know who will meet her will benefit from meeting someone from another culture. And you, too, will come to know me. I just want to be friends with her, that's all.""

To my surprise, he replied: ""You don't go breaking her heart, OK?""

I said: ""Well, that I can't promise. If she falls in love with me, it will be because she likes who I am. And also, there is the chance that it doesn't fit and that this will end after one night together.""

He laughed. He told me that he was OK with it, but made me promise that I would act like a gentleman and a friend. 

So yesterday night, I went there to buy some milk even though I had enough in the fridge. I saw in her eyes that her brother told her about the story. We both laughed even though I hadn't said a single word. I asked her if she would want to go out next Wednesday. She said yes. I asked her what she liked to do. She replied in French that she always wanted to go bowling since she saw the movie ""Kingpin"" when she was younger. Yes, Kingpin, my favorite comedy ever...

So, I ask you Reddit... Do you have any tips for me? Anything I should know about Indian culture to make it a good first night and not fuck this up?

182205,"OK so I just pissed off my very Mormon neighbor today. First let me give you a little history. I left the church a few years ago, I no longer, believe in the church, or in a god, I am an atheist. My brother served a mission, but no longer believes in the church, he still thinks there might be a god though, but that, if god exists, god is probably way different than any church makes god out to be. 

This September, in order help save money, my brother and I moved into to an apartment together here in Provo by splitting rent; also for me to be closer to family who are all in Utah county (I moved from SLC). From the time we moved in we have had this neighbor who has been very friendly, giving us bottled fruit, home-maid jams, and other treats, but early on we got on the discussion of church, and I politely told her I was no longer an active member. Ever since then, She's been cleverly been trying to do missionary work. Dropping by invitations to ward events, and giving us LDS pamphlets, along with treats, etc. 

One day she came by and said she was 'The Block Master' for a community, emergency preparedness program, and had some pages about food storage, what to do in an emergence, and ways to signal in the window how urgently we need help in-case of a natural disaster, etc., but she also had a questionnaire to fill out, that was full of questions like, what was your former ward, who was your former bishop, how long have you been a member, did you serve a mission. If so where, etc. Curiously soon after we had missionaries stop by. Every time she would stop by with these things I'd politely remind her I was not active longer, and subtly try to make it clear I was not interested in returning to church. I've never gone into detail with her about what I really think of the church, I've always thought it would be too confrontational.

So this morning at 8 AM she comes knocking on the door. Which is early for me, and she knew it because previously she had stopped by at 10 am one weekend, and saw that I had just woken up, and I told her how I'm not much of a morning person. Anyway this morning she came asking if I would come to church today, because it was the Christmas program, and she was singing in the choir. I told her once again I was not a church-goer any longer, she then said in a suddenly very loud, almost angry voice, (I'm quoting as best I can remember) “Can't you just go this once for the special celebration, of birth of our savior Jesus Christ! Even Catholics go to church twice a year for Christmas, and Easter, can't you be a Catholic!” I then told her very sternly “I'm really not interested in going back to church.” She then then ask me to go wake up my brother right then, and ask if he wanted to go to church. At this point I was ready to explode, I couldn't believe how demanding she was being. I knew my brother would probably not want to go either, and that he would probably be mad that he was so rudely awakened, though he was probably already awake with her yelling so loud. So I told her he probably would not be interested either. She then got this shocked look on her face and yelled, clearly angry “He should know better! He served a mission! He proselyted to the world about the truth of the gospel!” This finally made me snap ,and I said out loud to her “I don't need this!” and I slammed the door in her face, and walked away.

The funny thing is I'm really not an angry person. I'm usually very quiet, keep to myself, and try to be very non-confrontational. I have never even once gotten angry at a neighbor before. I guess she was just pushing all the wrong buttons too early in the morning, and I couldn't take anymore of her trying to cram religion down my throat. Since then all I have been able to think about is how I should have said something even worse like, “You know what I think about your religion!?! I think Jesus, and your God is just a fairytale, and Joseph Smith, Brigham Young, and a host of other early prophets and founders where a bunch horny con-men!” Then slam the door.

Is that Bad?

Thanks, I just needed to vent and get this off my chest.

UPDATE: She just came back with a face almost in tears, and apologized. The experience this morning probably ruined her whole Sunday Christmas service. I told her everything is fine. I just hope she was sincere, and that she will tone down her religious zealotry from now on.

Anyway, I've been here since October 2006 or thereabouts, have participated in secret santa twice, etc.  This is the first time I've asked for help.  Not a troll, I swear.  

So, here's the deal. 

I am an American expat who lives in Edinburgh, Scotland. I am moving house to Germany (Aachen) on Tuesday morning. My boyfriend was supposed to drive the van, but he is stuck in Boston and will not make it on time. I don't know if my driver's license is valid here, but I don't know how to drive manual transmission and no one anywhere in the UK rents out moving vans with automatic transmission.  

The plan was to pick up the van at 8am on Tuesday, load it and drive to Newcastle. A ferry leaves Newcastle for Amsterdam at 5pm, arriving at 10:30am the next day (22nd December). From Amsterdam, we were to drive south, through the Netherlands to Aachen, Germany, where we'd unload the van and stay the night. 

The next morning (23rd December), we take the van to Calais, France, and take the ferry to Dover, drop off the van, take the ferry back on foot, and then catch a ride back to Aachen. (The van cannot be left outside of the UK). 

New tenants are moving into my flat on WEDNESDAY already and the cleaners are scheduled to come on Tuesday afternoon.  My landlord will not help me out at all and it looks like me and my cats are getting thrown out of here on Tuesday morning whether or not we can find someone to drive the van.  I have a lot of stuff (a full household, really) in cardboard boxes that will just have to sit on the street with me and two cats while we have 3 inches of snow already and more on the way.

So, what I need the most is someone to drive the van from Edinburgh to Newcastle and to get it on the ferry for me. If any kind hearts out there would do this for me, or knows someone who would, I would really really be thankful.  

The only money I have, I was going to spend on installing a kitchen in Germany (for some strange reason, in Germany flats are rented out without a kitchen sink or counter tops or a stove or anything, so you have to buy one yourself), but I can live off of my microwave for as long as is necessary.  

If, however, you know anyone in the Edinburgh area who has interest in getting to any of those places (or somewhere within 2-3 hours of the route), the tickets are all paid for already and I have a bottle of champagne and a birthday cake I was going to open on the ferry for my boyfriend's birthday, but we can just pretend that it's yours. The cabin has bunk beds and I'll pay for all of your meals and whatever you need.

I could also use some advice about the status of my license.  It's an American license.  I've lived here for 15 months now on a three year visa, but the stamp for my last entrance to the UK was in September (I was visiting Germany).  Someone told me that my license is only valid here for the first year of my stay.  Does that reset when I re-enter?  

Also, if I can only find a ride to Newcastle and get on the ferry, I know that my license is valid in the Netherlands and Germany.  Does anyone have any advice for learning a manual transmission on the fly?  I might be forced to do this.  

I guess the last option is to get someone to just pick up the van for me in Edinburgh and then give me the keys as soon as they get them signed over, and I will just pack all of my stuff into the van and live out of it until I can get things sorted.  

Anyone know of a warm place to park in Edinburgh?

The Omanyte Before Christmas  
By Me
  
‘Twas the night before Christmas and all through Japan  
from the top of Mt. Moon to the old SS Anne  
Not one person or Pokémon moved, for they knew  
If they weren’t asleep, Santa wouldn’t come through.  
In a shanty old house up in north Pallet Town  
Some magical things were about to go down.  
A young Drowzee boy lay asleep in his bed  
while sugarplum Clefairies danced in his head.  
Then he heard at midnight, Rhydon the minute,  
A sleigh and the loud Gastly voice that was in it.  
“On Golbat, on Fearow, on Beedrill, Doduo  
On Moltres, on Zapdos and on Articuno!  
To the Machop of the porch, Kabutop of the wall,  
Rapidash away, dash and Sandslash away all!”  
Then the boy heard on the top of his roof  
The Rattata-tat-tatting of each little hoof.  
Outside his window on that Christmas Eevee  
Was a creepy old man, intrusive and skeevy.  
He let himself in and he took a small looksie  
At a tall glass of milk with a big Psyduck-ookies.  
The old man looked north and the old man looked south  
Then e-Raticated the plate, put them all in his Meowth.  
But too fast, the old sport started Koffing and Weezing  
Machoking to death while convulsing and seizing  
He made such a ruckus while grasping for air  
That he rose to the little boy standing right there.  
“Why is this stranger in my living room?  
You’re not Santa; this Christmas is nothing but Gloom.  
Are you crazy? Retarded or mentally Slow, bro?  
Are you some kind of vagrant or Krabby old hobo?”  
Then the old man yelled out with the might of a lioness  
“I’M THE WORLD’S NUMBER ONE POKEMON SCIENTIST!  
I’m a professor and my name is Oak  
I’m here to give Pokémon to you young folk.  
It’s the season to give and to spread Christmas cheer.  
And I’m Seaking a boy who has been good this year.  
I know that it sounds quite Farfetch’d, but it’s true.  
Is there any small Chansey that that boy is you?”  
He then pulled out three pokéballs from his stow  
Red, blue, and green, each one topped with a bow.  
Oak said “Choose one of these guys to be your trainee”  
and right off the young boy knew which one it would be.  
He picked up the red one and smiled; Oak did too.  
Yelling out loud “Charmander, I choose you!”  
Gary Oak then burst in with a jump and a hurtle  
and said like a douche “In that case, I’ll take Squirtle!”  
So our boy set out in that snowy December  
To become a trainer the world would remember.  
With his pal Charmander, his journey begun  
He packed all his bags and embarked down Route 1.  
He ran and he ran, getting faster and faster  
Not stopping 'til he was a Pokémon master.  
  
So enjoy the season and do with the break whatever you intend.  
Merry Christmas to you and your family too and to everyone you call a friend.  
Christmas this year will come and go just like it always does,  
But I hope this one’s the very best, like no one ever was.

183611,"I'm not sure what I am expecting to get out of this. I guess I hope that talking about it at least will make me feel better. Here goes..

I am depressed a lot lately. I have been in the past, and I usually get over it, but this time its lasting a long long time. Most medication doesn't work for me, or I stop taking it. I tend to outsmart my psychologists because its just in my nature to never admit anything is really wrong. The whole psychology/psychiatry thing are complex and difficult, so its way too easy to convince them of a particular problem, get your pills, and move on while saying everything is alright.

It started with elementary school, when I moved. I was on ritalin, and I was very short and malnourished as a result. I hated eating, I was obsessed with germs and such. I got picked on a lot when we moved from one elementary school to another. I lost all of my friends, and was now the new kid who was tiny and a little odd.

My oddness just increased as I became a social outcast. Without friends, I stopped understanding how to interact with people. I became obsessed with AOL and IRC and things online. Video games, books, programming, everything that wasn't interaction in a physical space with people. This went on for a long time.

When I was 20, I finally decided, 'Fuck it, I'm going to get a girl.' So I did. It worked out pretty well, lost my virginity all of two weeks later. I started getting overweight when I turned 14 and got off ritalin, but that wasn't really a problem in my quest I guess.

But then I fell in love with her, and I married her. Logically, she is perfect for me and I don't know what I would do without her. We've been together 4 years... not a spectacularly long time, but longer than I've ever kept any non-family member around me. Its just.. I'm depressed. She went to college, she had all of these experiences and I have not. She's had 7 partners, and I've had her. I'm bi, and I've never done anything with a guy either, but she's fucked a few women while she was at it.

I'm stuck in a job. We have debt like cars, student loans, living, etc,  that we need the two jobs and can't get by on just hers or just mine. I don't dislike the job, its just not quite what I want but I'm scared to look for something else.

I hang out with some of my other friends, and all they can talk about is the latest person they banged, or the party they went to while I was asleep so I could go to work in the morning.

All of these thoughts, and I feel guilty for every one. I am upset about being overweight, while feeling guilty because I know there are people who can't get enough food. I want to leave my job and start my own business, while feeling guilty because I know there are people stuck in far worse financial situations. I want to have more sexual experiences, while feeling guilty because there are 30 year old virgins (I'm 24) and people who won't find someone who loves them as much as my wife loves me.

I stay awake sometimes and just wish I could leave everything behind me, all of this baggage from past shit, and all of the baggage from my friends and my wife and my debts and just move and start a new life somewhere else all by myself and see how it goes. Logically I know this is a crazy idea, but emotionally I just feel off track and lost and sometimes I feel if I can't just reset everything I may as well just end everything.

I don't know what I want, and I feel bad for not knowing and for taking the great things I have for granted, but what I feel is what I feel and I can't seem to make the thoughts stop or go away, and I feel like theres not much anyone can do to help me.

I got a $25 Gamestop/EBgames gift card that I just want to get rid of. I propose that if someone is willing to gift me a game on Steam I would be willing to mail them the card. I will also email this person the card codes ahead of time which can be used online for all non-DLC items (i.e. physical copies). If someone has a better idea present it.

I don't feel like I can quite eat how much they tell me to eat. I'm 6'1"" and 175 pounds, but it seems like I only need to eat maybe 6 protein servings, 1 carb, 1 dairy, 1 fruit, 1 vegetable, and a recovery drink. My days go something like this: 6 egg whites with breakfast, 6 oz. can of tuna for lunch (tsp of mayo), recovery drink with a scoop of protein powder and creatine after working out, then dinner with at least two servings of protein, a carb, and maybe a vegetable or two. Then I usually snack on a fruit or a dairy at some point. This seems to sustain me: I get hungry and then I eat (I probably eat something every 3 hours at least). The only time I would say I actually get hungry, but don't eat, is within 3 hours of bed: I assume this is alright, since we were told not to. In any case, I don't feel like I'm reaching the calories or filling all the groups that I'm supposed to. Is this a problem? My goal with P90X other than health is basically to make myself look good physically: lose fat and gain defined muscle. Am I harming my muscle gain by not eating enough?

184592,"I don't expect this to be a popular post based on the current sentiment here, but I feel like this is an opinion that needs to be expressed by someone.

I've been playing TF2 for over 2 years. Not as long as some, but enough to consider myself an experienced player. I started with the Xbox version, which is ""vanilla"" to this day with zero unlocks or new maps. I waited in futility for months for Valve to deliver on their promise to bring PC updates to the console. Eventually I gave up and installed a Windows partition on my mac. I could go back and play ""classic"" TF2 anytime I want, but I wouldn't dare because I love the variety we have now.

**TF2 is as good as it's ever been.** All these new items you love to complain about? They barely change the game. The best scouts still use the scattergun, the best soldiers still use the rocket launcher, the best demomen still use pipes and stickies, and the best snipers still use the sniper rifle. None of these polycount items have changed the game more than, say, the kritzkrieg, jarate, or letting engies move their gear and level 3 sentries to the front line. And none of you were saying shit back then.

The two (in my opinion) most useful polycount packs are hardly game-breaking either. I'm rarely killed by milkmen scouts (and they sure miss their pistol), and saharan spies are still just as flammable as regular ones. The saharan set rewards good spies and mercilessly punishes bad ones. If you let an undisguised spy get behind your team, you guys deserve to be stabbed. And if you don't notice a backstab kill notification or the distinctive stabbing sound effect, the spy deserved that kill as well. Not to mention the sniper now has *three* anti-spy weapons (jarate, razorback, shiv) and the engie has a wrench that makes them bleed.

I'm only focusing on the spy because he has arguably the best set though. So on to other complaints. You're whining that you have to buy the new items? No you fucking don't, and you can safely delete every crate that ever drops for you. Like I said, you're already competitive without these new items, and besides, they still drop like any other. Sure, it'd be nice if they were achievement-linked too, but that's hardly worth bitching over. I don't feel like any of these polycounters have an unfair advantage over me, because they have their own weaknesses and I rely on skill and teamwork to exploit them. Items that *did* change how you have to deal with someone - the razorback and chargin' targe most notably - were adapted to quickly and the complaints about them now are rare. And if that still doesn't change your opinion about the Mann-conomy, you can still trade or craft whatever it is you ~~need~~ want.

If anything, I'd say trading has had the worst effect on TF2 - it turned people into greedy little shits who spam the chat box with unrealistic demands. But that, along with my other issues with trading don't prevent me from enjoying the game. But since I'm in rant mode, I'll share my other thoughts about it. Hats used to be rare and a huge deal to see on someone. I always said if trading came, hats would lose their value because anyone could have any hat they wanted. And that's largely been the case. Now everyone has their favorite hat for their most-played class and hats are no longer rare or valuable. (That's not to say I don't like them - I like the axtinguisher even though it isn't rare or valuable.) And for all you who want an unusual - be careful what you wish for. In a year, the same thing will happen and every teammate will have a flaming cloud around their head. We'll cross that bridge when we get to it though - the point is I find stuff that annoys me too, but I don't whine about the free content and I still love the game as much as ever.

Finally, there's the people complaining about the dilution of the art style. I suppose this is the most valid complaint, but I feel like we brought it upon ourselves. We've been begging for hats for a year and a half now - what did you think would happen? Valve is just giving us what we want. And I think trading is to blame for this too. That's why everyone you see is wearing a funny hat now - they liked the hat and traded for it. Some people are never happy.

tldr: Stop whining. Valve has given us more free content than I've ever seen for any other game. None of the new stuff you can **optionally** buy puts you at a disadvantage if you don't have it.",-1,-1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

184677,"I recently switched an extra phone line I have with Vonage to my Shaw Home Phone plan (extra line $5/month promo).  I cancelled my Vonage account Friday and while I was on hold I happened to be surfing Shaw's internet services pondering when the per usage billing was going to kick in, and much to my dismay - there it was - added to the [High Speed - Extreme](http://www.shaw.ca/en-ca/ProductsServices/Internet/Extreme/default.htm) details page. 

* **$1.00/GB for each GB used above plan's limit**

So I message one of my friends on MSN about it and he responds with ""I only used 35GB last month"" so I was like how the fuck did you know that?  He sent me a screen shot of his secure.shaw.ca login page with a link to usage under ""My Shaw Internet Services"" header.  Well my account has never had this.  So I figured well shit that sounds handy to be able to keep an eye on my usage.  My wife and I have laptops and I have a PC and a server in my home office.  I have monitors set up on everything to keep an eye on usage, but monitoring it right in my Shaw account sounds much better! 

Off the phone to Vonage - on the phone to Shaw!  I was shocked when customer service picked up immediately.  She was pleasant, and I asked about the missing link.  She directed me to technical support and transferred me - again they picked up immediately. 

This is when things get interesting. 

I ask the technical support specialist about the missing link from my account - he indicates all accounts are being upgraded in the next little while and there will be no more online usage statistics for anyone who happened to have it already.  In doing so, he also casually pointed out while the per usage overages are now in effect, the monthly transfer limits have also dropped. 

I was like ""Come again?""  He proceeds to explain it again.  So I asked ""Isn't that a little shady to start charging overage penalties while at the same time lowering the monthly transfer limits and removing the ability for customers to monitor usage through secure.shaw.ca?!""  He rambles on like a loyal employee so I interrupted him and ranted a bit to make myself feel better. 

I've had my share of minor issues with Shaw over the years, but is it just me or is this really, really fucked?

**tl;dr** Per usage billing now in effect [with Shaw](http://www.shaw.ca/en-ca/ProductsServices/Internet/Extreme/default.htm).  Plan limits also lowered.  They will also remove access to monitor your usage from secure.shaw.ca (online customer care) if you currently have it.  W.  T.  F.

** DON'T watch pro replays only. Watch amateurs/noobs play too!**

Perhaps it is obvious to some of you, but I think that many people aren't fully aware of this or at least don't put it enough to practice. I have been spectating *a lot* of my friends' games lately, and though they are all very strong players (2500-2700 diamond) with great micro and all that, the reason why they are not progamers is because they DO over-extend themselves, they don't have optimal army placements, and they have weaknesses all over the place during the entire game. The great thing is that as an observer, it's really easy to spot those weaknesses. Ever observed a game and thought to yourself ""Man, if the terran just sends ONE of those medivacs from his 200/200 army to do a marauder drop on this defenseless expo, he could deal soo much damage to the protoss while engaging his main army""? This kind of  remark could help you improve your own game a hundred times more than watching foxer do his fancy marine micro or whatnot.


Let me quote the oracle from the matrix here to elaborate my point: ""There are programs running all over the place. The ones doing their job, doing what they were meant to do, are invisible. You'd never even know they were here"". 

When watching a pro replay, there are so many things they do that are completely crucial to the game which would go completely unnoticed by the average player. I find that watching from players who are not much more skilled than you is extremely helpful. You can learn from the mistakes of the guy playing your race, and you can learn to exploit the weaknesses against players of the race of the guy he's playing. So what's the use of watching pro replays, you ask? Not correcting your own mistakes, but learning new moves. I didn't know marines could be efficient at all against speed banelings that are not on creep until I watched foxer. I didn't know that getting a pure stalker/sentry army with early observer could be so good for fighting a terran who's camping his base because you can attack him from outside and exploit positioning. So obviously don't stop watching pros alltogether, just make sure you don't limit yourself to only that.

But with free will in mind, how can that be?  Just because God puts two people together he wants to be happy doesn't mean that one or both parties will decide to follow God's plan.  I'm going through something in my life right now that pertains to this, and I'm pretty miserable.  My friends/family keep telling me that if it is meant to be that it will happen or whatever, but after I realized that free will could potentially mess up God's plan for us, I'm actually starting to question everything about my faith.

And this doesn't have to be limited to relatiionships/marriage.  For example, what if God gives us a great opportunity to get a job, but what if the employer simply chooses not to follow this part of God's plan and does not give the job to us?

Well guess what, your guilty conscience was right: you should feel bad, maybe even worse than if you had pirated the games outright.


The bundle lets customers pay any price, true, but you still had some choice with conventional distribution: buy it at the regular price, or pay nothing and pirate it.


The bundle serves to give buyers an option between those two extremes. Regularly, you might say ""This game's price is $20, but I wouldn't pay more than $10 for it. I guess I'll just pirate it."" With the bundle, you are actually able to pay $10 if that's all it's worth to you.


I don't have much sympathy for pirates, but I can at least understand where they're coming from: $60 is a lot of money, and frankly, few games are worth that much to me. Paying nothing hugely undervalues a game, but when the only other alternative is up in the $50 - $60 range, it makes sense to me that people flock to piracy.


But with this bundle, even that excuse is removed. These games are obviously worth more than $0.01, so choosing to pay that when you can literally choose any price is an insult to the work of the developers.


The bundle legitimizes being a cheapass: it's no longer technically piracy, but don't fool yourself into thinking you're not an asshole.",-1,-1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Basically, I bought a house at what turns out to be a way too expensive price and was laid off over the summer. I was able to keep paying my bills over the last half-year out of my savings, but have been unsuccessful in selling the house so far. The worst thing is that the value of my home is about a hundred and fifty thousand dollars less than when I bought it for 8 years ago. 
I finally got a new job (yay!), but it is located almost three hours away from where I presently live and pays a lot less than what I used to earn. I can't afford to keep this house anymore so I really need to get out of this mortgage and stop paying for something that is worth far less than what I owe for it. Should I just bankrupt? I have pretty much a perfect credit score because even during my half year out of a job I never missed a payment, but I don't give a shit about my credit score because I don't plan on getting a loan or starting a business anytime soon, if ever. My credit score has zero importance in my decision. 

Just to clarify, I don't want some kind of loan modification or refinancing. I want to get out of this mortgage because of the huge drop in value of the house and my necessity to move because of my new job. Also, I am wary of selling for too cheap of a price (the present market value of the home), because that would mean having about 75,000 dollars worth of debt even **after** selling the home. That is why I am seriously considering bankruptcy.

What is the best thing to do?

several months ago i met my current girlfriend. And to be straight to the point, she's been the greatest lay i've ever had. Things were great because we were relaxed, honest and comfortable with our bodies.

now, I'm more of a vanilla person when it comes to sex. i know sexxit might not appreciate that, but not all of us are turned on by threesomes, anal and orgies. recently i've come to know more about my girlfriend - that she has an interest in all of these things, and might even be interested in MMF and FFM, if only as something that she thinks about.

let's get this straight - i actually love my girlfriend still. but while we're having sex, usually after releasing the tension of the first orgasm - my brain remembers all of this, and i lose my hard-on - i just get turned off when i imagine these things. i distract her by making small talk or doing something else until i can get going again. i've begun to think that we are sexually incompatible. sexxit, you can blame it on me, but that's the way my brain, and in extension, thats the way my emotions run.

Love. Live. Life. Proceed. Progress. That’s who I am and who I’ll always be. You see, we’re all living on borrowed time, so I’m not worried about this situation. Life happens quick. The more time you spend contemplating what you should have done…you lose valuable time planning what you can and will do. Trying to tear down the past prohibits you from building up your future. So for my time here, my physical will be confined to the yard. My love and my spirit, however, know no boundaries.

I’m in good spirits man, for real. My kids
race through my mind all day. They know they were created with love, so love is how their life will be defined. I just hope my love and adoration for them provides a temporary bandage on a wound I unknowingly inflicted on them.


Real soon, you can catch me blogging for ESPN again thank you espn for not letting my passion for sports perish. I work out a lot because it helps pass the time. I read the Bible everyday. Jail didn’t make me find God, He’s always been there. They can lock me up, but my spirit and my love can never be confined to prison walls.

But this isn’t all about me, you are the reason for this letter. It’s because of you Rebirth went gold when critics aborted it. It’s because of you Young Money is and will always be a movement. If the weight of the world is on your shoulders, I beg of you, place it on mine. That’s the least I could do for you, after all you have sacrificed for me. If I could, I’d write each one of you back. Because of this, my team and I have created a website where you can view my letters. Each week I’ll answer as many questions as I possibly can.


Mia Edwards (Southern California) – I wish you nothing but the best for you. Earning your Masters in Library and Information Science is beautiful. I’ll keep you in mind whenever I decide to do an autobiography on my life.


Kelly Holloman (Brooklyn) – I still remember your letter. You have a great spirit. Thank you for the words and being a real fan. I love you.


Nurris Terrero (New York) – Your letter was so thoughtful and sincere. The way you worded everything left me in awe. Please send suggestions on books I should read. I look forward to checking them out.


For real, this will be the best way we can communicate for the coming months. The same way yall miss me, I miss yall, only 100 times more. To those who hate. Hate is only a form love that hasn’t found a way to express itself logically. Keep sending the letters and I promise keep responding. Thank YOU, thank YOU, thank YOU. No matter what they do to erase me, my love for you will always be permanent. Remember that. Take care. God bless.

Give me the patience that I need
To keep my piece of mind,
And with life’s cares, I hope, Dear God,
Some happiness to find.
Give me the courage to face life`s trials
and not to from troubles run.

 I've become pretty proficient at demo, drywalling, among other things, but do you have any protips this guy can learn from?  I'm on a pretty tight budget, so this has been the ultimate DIY challenge - and the kitchen will be no exception.

A couple questions:

* My wife and I are still debating on vinyl vs. tile vs. laminate.  Since we're on a tight budget and I'd like to be done with this remodel ASAP, vinyl would be the obvious choice.  We could either do the rolled vinyl or [this bitchin' vinyl tile](http://www.armstrong.com/flooring/vinyl-tile/carlsbad-ii-grey-resilient-vinyl-tile-A0255/floor-107577.asp).  A friend of mine used it and said you have to pretty much get on your hands and knees to tell it's not actually ceramic.  The only problem is that we can't find the latter type anywhere.  We did laminate in the living and computer room and I'm impressed in how it turned out, but I'm not sure how I feel about it for the kitchen.  Opinions on this?

* Cabinets.  We are buying unfinished oak cabinets and staining them ourselves, stain color TBD but we would like to keep it medium-light colored.  As you can see in the pics, we have around 12 cabinets to stain, so using little foam brushes is not feasible.  What type of stain gets the best coverage, and what's the best way to do so?  Also, should we get the stuff with clear coat in it, or just do it separate?

* Any other tips that would maximize the quality that I can get out of this room?  The kitchen on this house is a huge selling point because of its size, and that also makes it a potential money pit.  There is a ton of stuff I'd like to do, but we will be selling the house in about a year in a half when I'm done with school so I really can't sink a lot of money in it.  At the same time, I love to cook so I want a great kitchen, and I want it to rock the socks off of potential buyers whenever we do end up selling the place.

I will keep you posted in the next month on the progress and follow up with some final pics - demo starts next week after Christmas.  I made a mock-up in Google Sketchup of the layout we're going with but it's on my other computer... I'll add it here with some screen shots when I get to it later.  Thanks for your help!

After a couple weeks, he wised up to my interest in him and he pulled me aside (drinks involved) to tell me he would NEVER cheat, really enjoys hanging out with me but friendship is all he is after.  A couple of months go by, he breaks up with her and we're still hanging out.  Hanging out becomes a very regular thing and by month 4, we are hanging out nearly daily.  Today, we're both single and incredibly comfortable with one another.  Most people we meet think we are a couple and when I tell acquaintances ""no"", the common response is ""yeah, right"".

There has been absolutely NO kissing, cuddling, or physical lines crossed.  There has also been no clear cut conversations as to boundaries/feelings toward each other.  He does check out other girls and comment when we are at the mall/bar/etc.  Sometimes, he treats me like one of the guys.  However, it's very apparent I am seen as a girl, with all the differences that implies.  I do talk about other possible (albeit minor) interests and he shoots down every single guy I even remotely like.  I am not his physical ""type"" but I'm not unattractive and I know there are a few conflict in our dating styles but I know we have the makings of a perfect relationship, if we were to start one. 

tl;dr :  I know I love my recently acquired best friend; he hasn't approved or denied the possibility of more.  Or has he?

So, reddit... how do I tell if he is really just a friend?  How do I go about talking to him/taking it to the next step?

187586,"I’ve been on the site for 6 months now.  Have messaged probably 130 women, been on 10-12 dates, fooled around or had some kind of sexual encounter with a couple women.  Here’s what I learned, hope it helps:

1.	**Don’t build them up too much**
I mean two things by this:

a.	Don’t get hung up on any one girl too early

b.	Don’t imagine them as being your dream girl or being one way or another until you actually meet them.

To Elaborate:

a.	I’ve messaged an amazing girl for 6 weeks (she was out of town) and had her flake out at the last second.  I went on an awesome date with a gorgeous 5’10” model, had her write me saying how much she enjoyed the date, only to have her delete her account a couple weeks after our date. I had an awesome time fooling around with one girl only to have her lose interest.  It’s so fun to get excited or be stoked on a particular girl you like, but try not to get ahead of yourself.  You’ll come off as needy to them and get yourself really disappointed when things fizzle out.  Most things will fizzle out or not work out.  Expect it and just enjoy the chase and the action you do get.

b.	Don’t put them on a pedestal.  I found myself reading through a girl’s profile and imagining and projecting all sorts of things about her.  She became more amazing and interesting in my head the more I let my mind run away.  Dude, she’s just a person.  She could be fun, she could make good conversation, she might not.  She might bring up things that are really not that attractive.  She might be totally boring and sarcastic.  You don’t know til you talk face to face.  Go into the in person meet up excited and ready to chat, but be aware that you don’t know her yet.  Let her be herself and be aware that she’ll have good things and bad things that you didn’t see coming.  The mystery of getting to know her is way more exciting than any girl you could have constructed in your mind.

2.	**Call them first**
You can tell a lot from her writing style and photos, but not everything.  Have a short conversation on the phone before the in-person meet up is a good way to:
a.	Determine if she’s worth your time and the conversation will go ok.
b.	Develop a little rapport so the first in-person meeting isn’t so awkward.

3.	**Give her a chance**
I’m a very warm extroverted guy; I turn on naturally around people and under pressure.  I like this in a girl.  A lot of girls won’t turn on naturally, a lot of them can be quite nervous and even cold at first.  If you’re attracted to her and think there could be potential, give her a date or two more before you write her off (or come to like her).  I’m aware this might contradict previous points, I obviously am still not sure how much of chance to give them.

4.	**Show more, tell less**
You say you’re spontaneous, chivalrous, innovative, curious, clever, risky, etc…
Realize that almost everyone is saying how they have fun socially desirable traits.  Why not show her you are these things with stories and photos?  It’ll be far more believable.

5.	**Assess the competition and steal their tactics**
Reverse the match search, and search other straight guys’ profiles.  You’ll start to see patterns and you’ll see the site from her perspective.  Obviously, you can’t understand “what women want” but it’ll probably give you ideas for your profile and understand how you fit in to the pool of single men.  I think you’ll start to understand what works and what doesn’t.

6.	**Don’t sell yourself short**
At least 3-4 times, I started my messages with disqualifying statements.  I’d start with something like “I know, I know, I’m a bit young for you…”  Why did I do that?  I have no idea.  Don’t do it.  Go in confident, give her your best shot, let her shoot you down, don’t shoot yourself down.

7.	**Personality and rapport matter most** 
This goes back to projecting about the girl.  I’ve had meet ups where before I wasn’t sure if this or that was quite right about the girl.  I remember literally thinking “she has kind of a really wide face” about a girl who turned out to be really fun and attractive upon meeting up.   All that bullshit you make up in your head will just fade away when you meet her.  Go for personality, go for rapport, go for the vibe.  I had the pleasure of getting naked with some okc girls who had Victoria Secret worthy bodies.  Not many, but a couple.  It was great at first: running my hands on the those hip bones, those legs!  Sure it’s nice and I’m glad I experienced it.  But if they don’t have personality and a connection with you, the awesomeness of looks just fade away.  The flesh loses its wow factor and being around her becomes more work than it’s worth.  Go for rapport.  When there’s rapport, her flaws just seem to fade away.
This is a hard one obviously, looks always have their pull.  Maybe you need to get bored with looks for yourself.

8.	**Fail often**
At this point, I’m so used to the site, that I just fire out random messages here and there to see if I can get a response.  You’d be surprised how many of these half hearted attempts work and all of sudden you end up with a date with a cool and/or hot girl.  Expect to fail often, fire out a ton of messages.  Expecting to fail, instead of seeking your dream girl or lay, will help you maintain your energy.

9.	**Don’t burn out**
All these false starts, all this emotional energy, and time meeting up/messaging can be exhausting.  A lot of people just get tired and start to hate the site.  Take breaks if you need to, but keeping putting in the work, you’ll get better at it.

10.	**This will make you better**
I would have loved to meet a girl to spend/share quality time with.  I didn’t (or haven’t yet).  However, I did get alot better at the process of dating, talking with women, and knowing what I wanted.  It made me far more confident with women and I started approaching far more offline women.  I started to actually know what I want and appreciate in women.  I realized what I was worth and that I am capable of getting quality women.  I learned to control my mind and tendency to project.  I learned to expect failure, approach often, and not sell myself short.  It gave me hope that there are actually are far more interesting, hot, single women out there than I believed before.  I wish I would have tried it before now (at 24).  Life’s just too short to go through constant dry spells.  

You’ll have to go make your own mistakes and learn a lot of this for yourself, but I hope my experience can help.

edit: 
11. **Be playful**
I've done this one too many times not to mention.  I write these long serious messages with really forward compliments.  I think I thought I was showing that I was ""confident"" but given the success rates of these messages, I'm pretty sure it just comes off as overly serious and/or impatient.  I got impatient because I've been through so many interactions that I want to get right to the point, but it probably seems like I'm jumping the gun to them (or they have just lost interest).  Keep it light and fun.  Don't move too fast.

* What the Uni experience is like
* What universities offer the best courses.

188889,"So recently I learned that my mom is kind of agnostic.  She was taught Christianity when she was young and still has remnants of those beliefs in her.  She says she goes back and forth on God.  When I heard that I couldn't help thinking ""How old are you and do you seriously still believe in fairy tales?""

I think a few books on religion/God would probably do her a lot of good because at some level she is an atheist.  She is kind of de facto a Christian because that's how she was raised.

I just want her to be able to admit that she does not believe in God.  She says she rarely thinks about the concept, but to me it seems that she only holds on to it because she is afraid of the concept of no God.  

I love her and I want her to be as rational as possible.  I feel like a great weight will be lifted from her shoulders if she were to admit to herself that she does not believe in God...

...so does anyone have some book suggestions for me to give her for Christmas?  I plan on getting two anti-theist books and one novel so that it doesn't seem like I am ""attacking"" her.  I'm leaning towards The God Delusion as one of them, which I have read in part but because I was already an atheist the arguments were very obvious to me.  I'm also thinking about God is not Great, although I haven't read it.  A book that shows the really bad side of the bible and religion in general would be a good one, I think.

TL;DR: Mom goes back and forth on religion.  I want her to realize the truth for her sake.  What books should i give her for x-mas?

189086,"Well, I don't really have the finances to buy the ring outright so I'll have to get some mini-loan for it. I presume that jewelers offer payment options, correct? Even if they do, is there a better way to go about it, like going to my bank and asking for a loan and paying the bank back instead of the jeweler?

So how does a person actually figure out what ring to get? I think some couples will go and actually pick out the rings first, but if this is the case, how is it a surprise to her when he finally asks? What I would preferably like to do is pick out some ring that's exchangeable and once the Q is asked and she's all surprised about it, we bring the ring back and figure out which rings we really want. Does this ever happen? One of the drawbacks with this method is: What if that jeweler has nothing she likes? That jeweler is probably expecting us to spend our money with him, so do jewelers usually bind you into some agreement in order to do this ""exchange"" idea?

This probably makes no sense. I'm 30 years old and I've never been to a wedding. I am probably brainwashed by Hollywood on how weddings actually work, so any advice in this area is appreciated.

189285,"I think I need to give the background story first and I am sorry it's long:

I had been with my (ex) boyfriend for three years. His best friend was my ex at the time so he kept us a secret from him. As a result, I never get invited out with him or introduced to anyone. Anyway, last year, while using his computer for school work, I found a video in has trash bin. I naively thought it was a video he made of himself playing the guitar so I opened it. Wrong. It was him having sex with another girl. A girl I knew too. So he comes home after I call him sobbing and he breaks down and long story short, we continue on with our relationship.

Well, he continues texting this girl and when he would go out to the pub with his best friend, she would be there too. This was hard to find out. He would delete her texts and deny being in contact with her but I found the log on his cell that clearly showed they were texting back and forth, with me sitting in his room with him. Already my trust is waning even more.

We moved from that city to a new one to go to teacher's college. We live together and I thought that finally we could escape everything from the previous city. We were accepted at different levels (him to teach Intermediate/Senior, me Junior/Intermediate), so we were in different sections. One night, he goes out with some people from his section and a girl (who is his now closest friend and is pretty much engaged) kisses him. Me, being the now paranoid untrusting person found out from the texts in his phone, which also show that he told her ""You woke something up inside of me"". Now, I tried to keep things together after that but I couldn't. He had never once introduced me to anyone as his girlfriend or invited me along somewhere with him. My self-esteem has been obliterated as well as my ability to trust people (which I never had before anyway, he gave that to me).

He broke up with me three weeks ago saying that he had lost his feelings for me and was still with me to keep me happy. (HA!) I just keep wondering what happened that night though, because so many details don't make sense and I just don't trust him to tell me the truth anymore. My question is: Would it be wrong of me to ask her (the girl that kissed him)?

*EDIT:* Part of why I want to talk to her as well is that she had been trying to meet me to apologize but she had waited so long that all the anxiety and other emotions had built up from what he had done to me previously. I knew that meeting her in person would end up with me breaking down. She happens to be good friends with a girl I am friends with in my section. However, I feel like she might see me in the wrong light and take me to be a bitch, which I swear, I'm not. I just want her to know why I couldn't talk to her and ask her her side of the story. She has no idea what he has done to me.
So sorry for the wall of text. This is just really eating me up inside. Every time I try to talk to him about our relationship, he either ignores me completely or tells me that if I want to be friends, that I need to ""stop shoving things in his face and ripping his head off again and again and again""...which I'm not doing!

190462,"A little background information I am currently taking a semester off from college, and I have noticed some trends over certain groups of people, and how they use/learn of new technology and/or information. Here is just a small theory of what I have observed.

Before I can go into detail it is important to devide up people into certain ""Types"". These types while generally unique to a certain characteristic (Example: Age) are not specifically restricted to that quality. There can be, and are outliers. Since the most significant trend is age, that is the order I will devide these groups into, numerically.

*Type 1: **The Super Young** (ages up to High School)

From what I have seen, these group of young individuals have a unique ability to obtain new information. While not all do, most seem to have an unique access to technology, whether it be through advertisment, or talking to each (I honestly dont know how they do) they seem to have already more knowledge about computers and how they work, rather than older teenagers, or at least adults. While they might not be understanding what is going on, I have seen and talked to kids that ""have a general knowledge of what is going on."" This varies when going to poorer demographics.

*Type 2: **The Young** (ages High school to and through college)

This bracket or type is what I consider myself as well as most of the demographic on reddit. In this bracket I include people in their 40's, 50's, possibly even older. While the age is somewhat indicative of this group it is not waht *defines* it. This group is more consisted of people that care and/or have a passion for technology and information. Not necessairly that they love it, but they have enough motivation and reasoning to see how powerful of a resource it is to **want** to learn it so that they can apply it to there every day lives. These people know how a computer works, pay attention to everyday events, and look foward to new technilogical improvements for the future. 

*Type 3: **The ""Try""ers (age varies)

This group seems to me to consist more of the generation before me. People aged 45 and up, but is not restiricted to this whatsoever. I have met people aged 18 up to 25 that I would still put in this bracket. By ""Try""ers, I mean they have access to the technology, but for their reasons (whether it be personal or just choosing not to) they don't take advantage of it. People that have the iPhone but choose not to see the other options, but also dont try to use its maximum potential. Maybe a good metaphor would be that they ""get the new model every year, but dont know why rather than just for the reason of getting the new model."" I could see  Type 3 moving into a Type 2, if he/she really wanted to.

*Type 4: **The Useless** (ages old)

Now before anyone flips out, I do **not** mean that these people are useless. Put whatever title that fits yourself there. These people again while are generally old, do not have to be. These people do not have access to technology either because they can't, or are ignorant. The elderly already seem to be at a disadvantage here for obvious reasons. But I have met other young and middle aged people that would fit this category. You could say that these people are self- acclaimed. That they expect everything to be handed to them. While not always rich, it is a trend that I have noticed.

So what was the point of laying out all of these ""Types""? It comes down to that these ""groups"" define how and/or what people know/learn about technology or information. I could easily see a Type 1 teach a Type 3, how to attach a file in an email. One example I have seen myself was a technology that was just becoming availible to a Type 3, but was availible and used by Type 2's for years. If I had to choose one program specifically I would say ""Skype"" (although through my eyes I would say Skype became ""cool"" more than anything else, but that is a total different argument.

Well, I seriously fell off the wagon for Thanksgiving, and I jumped up to about 218.  Eep!  Then I hopped back on the wagon and started a [blog](http://glennarochelle.blogspot.com/) on December 2.  Then I fell back off a little bit during pre-finals and finals week (I didn't work out at all, but I did keep eating consciously, even though I didn't count all of my calories), and didn't keep up with my blog.  But now I'm on break, and I am back on the wagon until I reach my goal!  I weighed in this morning at 207.4!  Going off of my official start weight of 216 (how much I weighed at the start of the blog), I have lost 8.6 pounds in 19 days.  Not too shabby, eh?  Hopefully that number will skyrocket between now and when I go back to school on January 10th.

Anyway, in my haste to get home, I forgot to pack the few workout DVDs that I have :/  So, what are your favorite torrentable workouts (I'm broke, and in a podunk little town that probably doesn't have any stores in which I might find passable workout DVDs even if I had money, haha)?  I just got my hands on Jillian Michaels 30 Day Shred, so I'll definitely be doing that, but I get really bored doing the same workout day in and day out if I don't have some other things to throw in there.  Suggestsions?

Also, good luck to everyone in this, the season of cookies, brownies and encouraged seconds, thirds and fourths!  We can do it!!!

**Edit;;**

I also have netflix!  I know they have a lot of videos available for streaming, but I don't know which ones are most effective, so if you guys have tips on those, that'd be wonderful (also - I love to dance, so dance-centered videos are excellent :])


***Edit 2;;***

K, this one's important.  I just started Jillian Michael's 30 Day Shred, got to the pushups and nearly bit it.  I have this really horrendous pain in my elbow (not a pain from working out like ""oooh ow, I'm not used to that"" but more of an actual joint problem- probably tendinitis), and I can't do the pushups.

    * 1: Why did your household decide to take in foster children? Our company is under a larger company that provides services to the needy. It was just another service that the company decided to start. 
    * 2: How many children did you foster total? How many at one time? What age ranges and for how long a duration? I think I've had about 40 different children since I have been working at the group home.
    * 3: Do you keep in contact with any of the foster kids? If not, why not? Some of the ones who have aged out do keep in contact with us as an organisation but on a personal level it is not allowed due to privacy. Generally the younger clients who are reunified with their parents don't have much contact with us once they go home, mostly due to privacy.
    * 4: Which foster kid do you remember most fondly? Due to privacy I can't give names but we had a child that was very sweet and cooperative in her case plan. She made good grades and was helpful to all children and staff. 
    * 5: Which foster kid was the most disruptive or the biggest problem? I had a early teenage girl who had an obsession with becoming pregnant. Finally she did become pregnant. Because psychotropic medications can cause birth defects she was smart enough to refuse her medication. On the flip side though, she was very mentally unstable and ended up assaulting staff. 
    * 6: What was your biggest source of frustration with the foster care system? Other staff undermining my directions. Also, the kids are spoiled and get way too much from the system. In fact, they get so much that by the time they are out they think they are entitled to brand name clothes, ipod touches, food and free rent and feel they do not have to work.
    * 7: What did the foster kids like the most about your home? Probably that we have a normalcy policy. Basically the kids are allowed to go on dates, go to the movies, and have cell phones. Even earn an allowance of $20.00 per week. 
    * 8: What did the foster kids dislike the most about your home? Probably that there were lots of schedules to cater to and that they could not get exactly what they wanted when they wanted it.  
    * 9: What was a funny or interesting event involving the system? Not really.
    * 10: What do you think the tenth question should be? Explain why, and also answer it. Sorry no further suggestions.

193716,"Dear Grooveshark,

Since my discovery of you recently, you've had an impact on the way I listen
to music. While not perfect, your simplicity and accessiblity allows for 
multi-platform, cloud-based and instant (well, we'll come to that shortly) access
to millions of songs. More songs than I'd probably ever wish to listen to.

This is almost perfect for me. I work on different operating systems,
multiple platforms and in various locations. It's not practical for me to 
carry a music collection around with me in some way that doesn't need
a lots of maintainence.

Grooveshark satisfies my entertainment while I'm home on Windows,
while I'm traveling to and from work on my Android device and while I'm at work
using Ubuntu Linux. And should I find myself on another platform, or a friends
machine? There's the free web-based client, of course.

Now, you may well have deduced from the above that I am indeed a paying customer,
since I have the luxury of using the Android app. I'm previously a VIP customer, but
now some other incarnation of which I am unfamiliar after your recent 
overhaul of available packages.

I was happy to hand out $3/month for my account in return for such an adaptable
service. But now you leave me with little incentive to remain, as I seek out
alternative means to easily listen to music on my Android device--the last feature
which ties me to your otherwise degrading pay service.

With the admirable introduction of your HTML-based web client, you see, you advanced
your free service far beyond the capabilities of your VIP service.

The web interface, like a mollycoddled call-girl in a middle-class neigbourhood
is clean, sexy and approachable.

The site itself: responsive and now stable in environments with otherwise flaky 
Flash support.^[1]

And most importantly, the service runs invariably. That is to say, whenever I 
log in, I am not presented with the error messages and service outages 
that I am frequently given on the Air-based client, and sometimes the 
Android client.^[2]

Whether it's an ""unknown radio error"" or an ""error communicating with Grooveshark""
or some other such vague and description-lacking banner sent almost certainly to
do nothing but frustrate, or to annoy; it's not to say that any and all service
downtime is unnaceptable by default.
 
No; the service down-time would be accetable, if after my frustrating attempts to
fire up desktop client, I were not able to quickly open up my web browser and find
the sexy web-based whore, legs in the air, receiving custom and running just fine.

So, tell me, Grooveshark; what possible reason have I got to stay? I'll forego the
$30 I paid for my years worth of VIP service, that isn't the primary issue. I'm
talking strictly usability and service here. 

Private BitTorrent trackers such as Waffles.fm and What.CD have gotten the service
right already--and have had it right for years. Passionate music lovers who make
up the users of such sites are often able to  release perfect quality copies of 
an album even before the distributor is able to.

Not questioning the morality of using such a service, it far out-performs any of
the tried alternatives out there, of which I need not delve fully into.

I once thought of services such as Grooveshark--and Grooveshark especially--as 
the shining light in the otherwise murky pile of shit that is the 
consumer-supported music industry, providing an alternative to buying music. 
But now I'm forced to return to my ship, don my hat and eye-patch, and 
ride the wavy seas of piracy once again.

Maybe I'll see you again down the line, Grooveshark. And instead of the once 
weak-legged calf I knew you as, you'll be a sterdy bull upon which I may gloriously
ride into the rodeo of music consumption.

Signed,

A fed-up redditor.

to produce the audio aspect of the application. But it seems to have made all
the difference by removing the entirity of the UI and leaving Flash to perform
one function. I've yet to have it crash under Ubuntu Linux (in Firefox *or*

minutes before leaving me with a white-screen of death, no matter what the Flash
player.

I don't think i'm handsome (at least i feel she might be out of my league ), but she is pretty (in my mind she's gorgeous) . This has brought up some self-esteem and confidence issues. (even posted on [amiugly](http://www.reddit.com/r/amiugly/comments/edopw/brutal_honesty_is_a_must_please/))


From the pictures she has posted on facebook, i'm almost sure there's a guy hitting on her. She wont tell me  if  any advances are made on her, and i dont want to be that intrusive.. but ill admit , its making me crazy . 

Shes returning for a couple of months and says she's happy to be back. We have not broken up. But i'm planning to find out what how she feels about us when  she returns. The problem now is that my self esteem had a huge impact, and i don't know if ill be able to get along with her without hurting the relationship, and the idea breaking up to see that she doesn't care scares the hell out of me .. ( remember , its been 3 years , i do have a lot of feelings for her ) ..

I dont want to be in a relationship, where it all depends on me. It was not that way before.. i dont know if she really changed or if im just overreacting.

 ( as a side note, i know multiple couples that have broke up in the same situation , it seems that the one who left is usually not that into his partner anymore ): .. any feedback on this would be appreciated )

so reddit ill ask for advice/opinion on how to cope with the low self esteem and how to continue .. if there is anything to continue

I'm a 23-year old bachelor who doesn't currently see this in my immediate future, but when I do head in that direction (i.e. marriage), then I feel like I would ask the father's permission in advance, if it were at all practical.  It wouldn't be binding if he said no, but it would be a way that I would attempt to develop a positive relationship with my bride-to-be's parents.

Clearly this is a tradition that has continued in society even though women are no longer seen as the property of their father, to be given to the suitor, and yet I feel that there still is a certain amount of protectiveness by the father for the daughter that is still upholding it.  So does it still have value?

My SO and I have dated for awhile, in fact, they were my first in THAT way. He ended the relationship last Saturday while I was at work. He didn't exactly tell me why except he couldn't handle my moodswings or anything else. These moodswings came about because in the last two months I have become so depressed. Friday night, the day before Saturday, they came over late (past midnight) when I had to be up for work at 6am the next day. I told him to get out basically after he stopped in to see me. After that, I immediately texted him and called him asking him to come back; I felt bad and knew I was wrong. I wanted to apologize. He refused and I begged him for hours. Then the depression part kicked in and I was sobbing and told him I would kill myself. He eventually got me to calm down, and I thought the whole situation was resolved. He texted me the next day at work and broke up with me.
The whole situation has made my depression worse. I can't seem to stop crying because all I can think about is him, etc. He doesn't want me back. I've poured my heart out multiple times and have essentially chased him.

I asked what for and explained a few times that I paid upfront and then later at the first collection agency. She said that one visit can get three different charges at different times. She would not say specifically WHAT the money was for. 

Tomorrow I'm going to go straight to the hospital and demand answers. However, I get the feeling I'm going to get non-answers in return.

&gt;Guydyke refers to a biologically male person who feels a strong romantic or erotic attraction towards lesbians, bisexual women, or lesbian culture. / In queer subcultures a lesbian-identified male is called guydyke.

(Background info: I'm a fairly young cis gay!girl.)

What. Can someone help me understand this? 

Yes, I realize this is ignorant, but when I think of guydykes/male lesbians, I think of cis men (not sure why I think of cis men!) that are attracted to lesbians - which, to me, is the same thing as being straight. I'm sure there are guydykes out there that are not straight/not cis, but..

I just can't wrap my head around the idea of a cis man identifying as a lesbian. I thought the definition of lesbian was 'women who are attracted to other women' so my brain short circuits when I hear ""male lesbian"" or any equivalent.. and then I think, ""Well, I'm attracted to women. Should I start calling myself a straight man?"" which is utterly ridiculous, I know.

I realize that men are often attracted to lesbianism and lesbians in general, but to actually identify as a lesbian? Gender and sexuality are fluid, etc. etc. but I *just don't understand this.*

196044,"So I found Gilksy's PS3 reflow YLOD fix and thought I would give it a try. Some backstory first. I went back to school this past semester and after a little argument with my parents over gaming habits we decided it was definitely for the better to leave my PS3 at home. The very next day once I'm all unpacked and settled in I get a phone call. Turns out my sister left my PS3 on playing a blu-ray all night in an enclosed entertainment cabinet. It died, and only shows me the yellow light of death followed with the steady red blinking light. 

So when I got home I tried everything I could find online. Hard drive formatting, resetting over and over. PS3 debug menu. Nothing worked, thing never turned on past going to a yellow light then red. So I had heard about Gilksy's YLOD fix, figure I had nothing left to lose so why not. 

After many hours of taking apart the PS3 meticulously, and using a heat gun to reflow the soder under the cpu and gpu, I put the bad boy together and plugged it in. Crossed my fingers, turn it on and OMG the light stayed green. I'm overjoyed, but skeptical, I wait a little longer. Sure enough, no less than 15 seconds later it goes back to yellow then red. 

All that time spent and no luck at all. Looks like I'll be w.o PS3 for christmas. Thank you Sony for making these units in china. I appreciate the 600$ you took for a 'top of the line' product, and now expect me to pay $150 more dollars to get it repaired. 

Only good thing to come of this is that my dads friend tried to fix it before. He said the third chip inside wasn't getting power. That third chip I figured out later was the PS2 chip. I gave the reflow fix a try just to make sure it wasn't the CPU and GPU that overheated and desoldered. So ya, looks like the ps2 chip is the culprit after all. Not starting up after checking to see if its active is why it stayed green for a little while.

Ever since I was 14, I've had the symptoms of and continue to develop social anxiety. Slowly, the feeling that I'm constantly being judged by other people has crept on me, and now I can't get out of it, or out of the house.

I never graduated with my class. Last year, I was a senior, and I had a panic attack in the middle of the year. I've missed school from grades 7-12, and every time I came back, I felt increasingly distant to my friends. 

During that time, I also started playing WoW excessively. Now, with no friends, no accomplishments, no job, I'm stuck at home, being a burden on my family. I can't stop playing WoW, I have no one else to contact or talk to. Even if I manage to hang out with people who are still around, I can't get myself into a mood where I can talk. I just feel...anxious.

I don't deserve any sympathy whatsoever. But, my parents do. They say after all this time that I don't worry them, but I can tell. I just want them to be happy again, for me to be happy again, and to have friends around that genuinely care about me again.

This month doesn't even feel like Christmas. It feels like yesterday, a year ago when I was preparing to send off my papers to colleges.

Even with all that I can acknowledge, I can't understand why I started to distance myself from my schoolwork and my friends. I can't understand why I failed my parents, who worked through all the pain and tears to give me the education that I did, and will continue to get.

I can't even look at myself in the mirror. I'm stuck in this house, behind a computer, ashamed of everything I've done, every chance I've missed, and even with all the logic and rationality in the world, I couldn't fight it. I walk into a situation unprepared, and walk away defeated. People ask me what I've been up to, and I freeze. I can't explain, I'm too afraid to do so, and I don't want to put others in a bad mood explaining what I'm going through.

Even the conversations I had during CBT left me feeling useless. 

What do I do? Why have I had this growing feeling that something's missing? 

I don't want to die several years from now from health complications because I wasted my life behind a computer. I want to get out. But I have nowhere to start.

Please, if you have any questions, ask. I'm not really good at explaining this.

**TL;DR - I've given into my addictions and my social anxiety, and I can't get out. Therapy traumatized me even further. I don't know what to do.**",1,-1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-1,-1,-1,0,-1,-1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-1,-1,-1,0,-1,-1,0

That little group that isn't even part of the social ladder because they promote from within their little group, and they promote laws and only do things that ensure that continuation of wealth and power. We're not running the country, they are!

For starters, forget money. I know I know hold on though. Think Star Trek. Okay okay sorry I didn't mean to touch that nerve either. Do you remember that quote Picard told Lily(a woman from the past) about his time's economics: 
Captain Jean-Luc Picard: The economics of the future is somewhat different. You see, money doesn't exist in the 24th century.
Lily Sloane: No money? You mean, you don't get paid?
Captain Jean-Luc Picard: We work to better ourselves. 

Why can't we do that? How much wealth you have depends on how much you contribute to society. Police Men, Teachers, Fire Fighters, etc... 
And everybody will get the basic neccesities: 
A roof over their head, a room for everybody in the household, food, clothing, entertainment (gaming consoles, computers, television) etc. All you have to do is try your damnedest to contribute whatever you can. Find something you love and do that.

So i turn on my laptop, search for a wireless network enter my WAP2 key and im connected.. However...

My wireless network keeps dropping out, say every 5 to 10 minutes, however it will reconnect to the network. but its a real pain in the ass if im downloading or playing on line poker for money! Sometimes i'll get an error message saying i have an IP address conflict with another computer. And say i wake up in the morning and turn my laptop on, it wont connect at all. even tho i can see the wireless network on my laptop. So to solve this problem i just switch off the router for say 10 seconds and that solves that.

Also when the connection drops out and reconnects it'll say either;

&gt; Wireless connection connected 'SSDI name here' (unsecured)
&gt; signal strength: Excellent

or

&gt; Wireless connection connected 'SSDI name here' (secure)
&gt; signal strength: Excellent

Now heres some specifics -

* I have one PC connected to the wireless router via an Ethernet Cable, and My laptop via Wireless.

* The distance between my router and Laptop is approx 10 meters, and our house is of brick construction.

* There are no other electrical devices next to the router (as in cordless land line)

* The wireless router in question is a **D-LINK DIR-615 wireless N router**

* My laptop is an **Acer Aspire 1650** with a **Intel(R) PRO/wireless 2200BG network connection** - its about 4 years old now.

* We have a broadband DSL connection (ISP telstra bigpond Australia)

* My laptop runs Windows XP

* I use Opera as my browser 

By all this information can anyone help me, or give me an idea what i have to to do fix this nusance.

196827,"I have been together with my boyfriend for a year and a half. He is 32 and incredible.  We have a wonderful relationship - we laugh all the time, we have a lot of common goals, beliefs and ideas, we have so much fun together, we care about each other, the sex is great (he has a HUGE sex drive, that I can keep up with most of the time), he's super sexy, incredibly smart, and very handsome :).  All in all, I am a very happy woman.  I'm 33 and really ready to settle down. 

Here is my problem.  If you can even call it that.  He was engaged before me.  We actually got together about 2 weeks after they broke up.  He said their relationship was AWFUL, and that he had been ready to end it LONG before he officially ended with it with her.  He said that their relationship started off well, and he really did love her, but that eventually they fought all the time, she liked the money he made and he doesn't think she liked much else about him, she was angry at him for nothing all the time, she didn't support his goals and his career, and she was constantly accusing him of cheating on her.  He was miserable with her, and is very happy with me (from what I can tell).

I know my boyfriend has had a pretty promiscuous past. He has never, EVER had problems getting women.  I am not acting in a strange way because I have these subconscious thoughts about him, I only wanted to get Reddit's opinion about something.  I have read on this board before that men who are pretty good with the ladies don't typically settle down until they meet ""The One"".  They change because they meet a woman they can't live without.  So far, so great in our relationship - but I wonder... can someone change that much?  If he and his ex were so in love, why did she start acting like such a bitch?  Was it that they didn't get along, or is there something wrong with him??

He is flirty, and he has lied to me about small (I mean tiny) things in the past.  I think the thing I get (quietly) upset about the most is that when marriage comes up, he doesn't exactly shy away from it, but he doesn't seem excited about it.  He has admitted that he had committment issues in the past, and that he only proposed to his last girlfriend (they were together for 4 years off and on) to get her to stop accusing him of cheating.  He didn't say that in so many words, but I understood what he meant.  He says he never cheated, but I have my doubts (knowing his past/how he can be).  They were engaged for a year, but didn't plan a wedding.

Now, my boyfriend has never given me any indication of cheating.  My boyfriend respects me, treats me well, is wonderful to my dogs and my family, and is everything I've hoped for in a man.  I have no reason to suspect that he'll fall back into the patterns he had with his ex (If there even were patterns), and they NEVER speak.  I am positive about that.  I guess I wonder, before I REALLY fall for him, if he is a player with a heart of gold who has changed his ways for me, or if people like that really change?  

edit: added tldr:  My boyfriend is amazing, but he and his ex-fiance had a terrible relationship.  Afraid (sort of) that he may some day turn into the person he was with her.  Can people change?

Ratatat is not dubstep... And it seems lately that any music that is electronic is called ""dubstep.""  It's not a major problem or anything I just think it dilutes the genre.  It's like calling Metal, Rock.  Sure the two are similar but they are not the same thing.

I started having anxiety issues (muscle tension, agitation, shortness of breath, needing to get up and move/make noise or something)--this is what started making me suspicious. I took a klonopin to take the edge off of that.

In context, I've been in a really long string of depression. Sleeping excessively, not wanting to get anything done, avoiding people and social situations, the usual. I take Lithium for (vaguely alluded to/sort-of diagnosed) Bipolar II, and had been put on Lexapro a few weeks ago, but stopped about a week and a half ago due to horrible somnolence that had me falling asleep at the wheel.

I don't blame the Lexapro, since it didn't even have time to really build up in my system, but today was like a really mild mini-mania of some strange kind. Or maybe just a day that I WASN'T depressed and felt exceptionally energized.

Any thoughts? Do you think this is some sort of rapid-cycling situation that I don't know about, or just an ""up day"" out of the blue? Towards the end of the night, I started getting a little concerned about my level of agitation. I am moving, so I won't see a psychiatrist until mid-January, and it will be someone totally new.

197292,"    So I've been going through a very rough time in my life lately and I have been forced to move back in with my parents. 
      Let me start this by saying I didn't have a horrible childhood or anything we were broke most of the time and my Dad worked his ass off and now makes a good living at what he does. 
       I just never have had any, and I mean any, deep conversations with anyone in my family. 
         I probablly feel closest to my sister who used to be an acrtess (I am a used to be musician lol) But she now has 3 kids and even when I try to sit down and talk to her It;s usually with 3 kids yelling and even though I feel we get each other, theres no real conversation there.
      So anyway I was watching the eclipse tonight with my 86 year old grandmother, and we were alone and I dont know I kind of would like one of those well heres what you need to do moments. But all she said was (WOW isnt it amazing, the universe.) I kept trying to engage her in different ways like isn't is amazing that we live in a place that has a moon that is exactley far eneough away to do this. Or you know the Myans would be rioting and tearing peoples hearts out now grandma, (she wont admit it but theres native american in us lol)or you know that the christians stole this time or year away from the pagans to make Jesuses birthday? I was only trying to do this to get some kind of reaction. I meen I feel like a 10 year old kid were even a negative reaction is better than nothing. But no I got (WOW isn't the universe amazing). I meen I'm going through a really shitty time in my life right now and I've started to realize that even thought I'm staying with them they can't or wont say or do anything that would acutally help me lol. It would just be to much to put out.
   I dont't know I hate to be an asshole but I havent really been around my family that much in the last ten years maybe even twenty lol and now that I am, all I see is my own dysfuntion and also no real help, or no way out.

When I turned 18 I met the prettiest girl I ever seen in my life. It didn't actually occur to me to pursue it, but my sister told me that the girl liked me and various other relatives encouraged me to go for it. It was a total debacle. I had no idea what I was supposed to do so I would watch how other guys acted and I tried to mimic them. That doesn't work.

I tried many times after that to form a relationship with others, but no one seemed interested. I was eventually driven so far into the dirt that I didn't really feel anything anymore. 

I thought there was something wrong with me. That dating and/or falling in love was just not an option for me.

After about 4 years of this I started a new job. It was a warehouse and the first job I had where I was working around a bunch of people. A friend at this job would come up to me and tell me that one of the girls working there liked me. I never had any idea who it was but I spent all my time half paranoid trying to find out.

Nothing ever happened there. Apparently I was supposed to do something I don't know how to do, for someone I couldn't identify.

My door ice dispenser started acting up this weekend. After releasing the pedal to get ice it was retracting more slowly than usual and making a pretty nasty squeeking sounds while doing so. Did some digging, pulled the thing apart and found what was wrong. The plunger type device that slows the door-flap down as it closes wasn't moving smoothly (picture [here](http://www.repairclinic.com/PartDetail/Large-Part-Image?imgID=886974&amp;locID=2948), lower left piece).

In hand I can pull hard enough to get it to move (it comes apart, just a plunger w/ gasket and a cup) but the spring in the door doesn't come close. Pulled it apart again, washed everything, lubed it with silicon and still nothing. Repeated the process with WD40, still no movement.

198960,"I recently started my graphic design degree, and basically the only thing that has changed is my stance on apple macs. When I started, I was like many, but being a long time PC gamer I also have a pretty high spec rig. Quickly, I began to realise I preferred working on my much more powerful PC to working on my Mac. Now I've moved from rabid fan to they're-okay-but-I-prefer-a-well-built-pc, I find it's like arguing with a brick wall about it if I ever try and talk about it.

I think, personally, a lot of the Mac love comes from never using a high spec PC. Of -course- if you spend £1500-2000 on a piece of tech, it's going to kick ass.

In a little under a month I have a 5000 word, masters level paper due for a Modernist Literature class.  I'm a Philosophy and Literature major, so I've decided to take a philosophical look at the concept of hope in the writings of Kafka.  I'll be focusing on The Trial and probably The Castle as well, and will be looking to Camus (The Myth of Sisyphus) and Sartre for some additional reading.  

I want to explore the existentialist idea of hope and how this is addressed in Kafka's writings (if at all).  Our general notion of hope is heavily influenced by religious culture, past and present.  It has associations with time (the future), meaning, and expectation.  If you look at this notion of hope in the light of existential philosophy, you're faced with a rather interesting situation. For most existentialists there is no God, no afterlife, thus life has no meaning in and of itself -- the assignment of meaning is left up to the individual.   When faced with this realization, life (as Camus would say) becomes absurd.  The existentialist notion of time is also different.  The present moment is the only time which can be affected, so the idea of 'hope for the future' is nothing but an illusion.

These are just some of my preliminary thoughts, and they are rather scattered.  Basically I need to get a working definition of what the existentialist notion of hope actually is and examine how it applies to/is explored by Kafka in his writings.

What do you think hope is for an existentialist?
What further readings would you suggest?
What are your thoughts on the idea of hope in the face of a meaningless existence?

So I've been planning to build a PC for a while. On my way home for Christmas I stopped at a Microcenter en route to buy most of my components. I had already bought a graphics card via Newegg during Black Friday, but when I reached the store (hundreds of miles from my place in Virginia) I realized I had left the card at home. Eager to build my rig, I decided to buy another graphics card in store in hopes of returning one or the other. I'm on a bit of a tight time table to return the card to Newegg however, as I won't be back for weeks.

Then I get home and find out my mom's getting the kids a new computer from Christmas. Fortunately I find this out right in time to tell her to cancel the deal so I can just build her one for way cheaper; thing is now I'm thinking maybe I'll just add the graphics card I'd bought earlier to the mix. It'd make their computer into a solid gaming rig, which I'm sure would make my younger brother very happy, especially since our (my) Xbox broke while I was out of town. I was planning on buying at least some graphics card, but probably something pretty low-end for their system. Right now though I'm really just looking to see if I can find a really cheap card to hold them until I can come home and put in the card I bought earlier.

Other times it is clear that the tank is simply bad at their role and cannot hold aggro off of me. (I have somewhat over-enchanted gear for a level 50 hunter and I try to apologize at the start of the run and always feign when I pull threat).

It is pretty maddening when you wait 30 minutes to get into a dungeon though, only to either have the group wipe once and disband, or to be kicked for some ridiculous reason.

201795,"We've been together for about three months and I already feel like I might break up with him soon, despite the fact he's probably one of the best guys I've ever dated. 

I feel like he doesn't really think about me or miss me when I'm not around - especially when I haven't seen him in a while (we haven't seen each other for about two weeks, because my family gets really crazy around Christmas time and I have no time to see him between holiday stuff and work). I'm probably really stupid for feeling like this because we talk over Facebook IM and so on and he's very sweet. But he never initiates contact outside of IM'ing me on Facebook sometimes. I always have to be the one to text him first (I *hate* talking on the phone, otherwise I'd probably be the one that has to call him first, too). And if he's not online, I rarely hear from him. He tends to sleep in late and I know people have lives and get busy and I take that into account, but you'd think he would at least send me a ""Good morning,"" or something like that, even if it's not a full on conversation. Just something to let me know he thinks about me a little bit. 

I decided to try experimenting and not texting him at all (usually I send him a ""good morning"" text or something like that) just to see if he would text me first for once, but nothing. I know he's not the type that would blatantly ignore me - if I say something to him first, he usually responds - and he's not that immature anyways. I'm 20 and he's 22, for the record.

It makes me kind of sad because I really do think about him more than any other person and it's depressing to think that it's all one-sided. What's worse is I know he's probably talking to his ex if she sends him messages (he doesn't really initiate contact with her either, but I think that's for different reasons), but if I don't send him something first, I get nothing. I know he's not cheating on me with her or anything, I've never been worried about that. They're friends and I'm friends with her as well. 

What's even worse is that guys I rejected because I liked my current boyfriend will initiate contact and I probably get more ""good morning!""s from my last ex than I do from my current boyfriend. Again, last ex and I are both over it, but we stayed good friends. 

Am I just being a crazy bitch, or is this something I need to worry about? Part of the reason this bothers me is because a guy I dated and *really* liked in high school did this same thing, but he would also flat out ignore me and admitted to me that he only dated me so that, essentially, he could have me on his arm in school. My current boyfriend is not in high school and also not that immature. 

I've been thinking of talking to him about this, but I feel like it's a stupid thing to bring up and I'm not very good at that sort of thing (usually I just delude myself into pretending everything is okay, but I want to do this relationship right) so I've got no idea how to approach him or go about it.

202109,"Some of you may remember that for a year or two after the Nintendo Wii became available in the US, they were difficult to find in stores and often sold on eBay for $100+ above retail.

One day, as a high school sophomore, I went to Sam's Club for the midnight release of Super Smash Brothers Brawl. As I walked up to the checkout counter, the cashier asked if I also wanted to buy a Wii. I already owned one, but I accepted this offer, thinking I could resell for a nice profit.

The next day at school I told some friends I bought a Wii and was selling it on eBay, hoping to make $100. A classmate (somewhere between acquaintance and casual friend) overheard this conversation, walked up to me, and asked if I would end my auction and sell him the Wii directly - for exactly the retail price plus tax.

He asked twice, politely but with palpable desperation. I declined since he refused to even compensate me for the effort of buying it. When he left, my friends said I should have simply sold it to him without any markup, ""just to be nice,"" in their words. I was very confused. Yes, if I sold it I would be ""nice"" but wouldn't I also be letting him walk all over me? He wasn't a very close friend; matter of fact, he was often rude to me at times. Selling him this Wii would not further our friendship in any way.

We were just friends until 2 months ago, which is when we starting having sex. Then we became friends with benefits. Lately, we have been hanging out a lot. The more I get to know him, the more I like him. We even took a rode trip together, just the two of us and nothing really went wrong. Now, I brought of the question of bringing it to the next level. I want to be more than friends. But like not even just to say we are boyfriend/girlfriend. Just to say we are dating, but he is hesitant. Apparently, this happened before, where he was really good friends with someone and it ended badly.  Since we ended up being close friends, he really doesn't want to lose that. We ended the conversation of him thinking about it.

I feel like I am willing to take the risk, but he isn't. For some reason, I feel like maybe he is just not that into me and is coming up with these excuses in order to soften the blow. If he isn't, then I have no problems moving on, but we just can't spend as much time together as we were once doing.

But they both spin in the same direction so this is not the case. I feel like there's some fundamental concept about this law that I'm not understanding.

An unfamiliar waking
In the place you used
to dream.  Only half
of everything is how
it should be

Half a clock, half a bird
half-laughs and half-loved,
half his hand – the other half

parts easily grasped.  

Sluggish fog churns about
houses - obscures intentions
of this half man never there.
Crawling mist, a ring that chokes
unwilling, little fingers.

It’s hard to breathe with feeling
stuck in the jaw,  and more
perched like a sullen raven.
Or all, impossible, like slipping
through the earth.

Half a story told well.
Endings are work, weaving
conclusions from meager
indications - that partial yes
or almost no, unfortunate,
quiet notes played.

Half-heard and barely

205047,"Hi Reddit,

I have somewhat of a problem, let me start with a back story.  

Around January 2006 I started leasing a server from a company called aHosting which no longer exists.  I made monthly payments to the server company for 3 years for $184/month.  In December 2009, I called up the company (aHosting) and asked them to suspend my services as I found a new host that was cheaper.  Come May 2010, aHosting got bought out by bHosting.  

Now for the problem, for some reason bHosting continued to bill me, and also never notified me 
of the buyout.  It wasn't until October 2010 that I got an email saying I was **5 months** past due on billing and they were **billing me for unpaid invoices**.

**I replied almost immediately with this email:**
&gt;I canceled my service with your company back when it was aHosting. I didn't even know that your company changed names so these emails kept getting marked as spam.

&gt;One of your employers cancelled my account via phone on my last billing period I paid.  I haven't used that server since. 

&gt;Please cancel my account and verify with me it is at mynew@emailaddress.com

**To which they replied:**
&gt;Thank you for your reply.  We have updated our records accordingly.
&gt;Let us know if you have any questions.
&gt;bHosting Billing

I thought everything was fine and they realized I had canceled my account with aHosting.  That was the last I heard from them until this morning when a collection agency contacted me about money I owe to bHosting.  He left me a voicemail saying that he dispatched a private investigator to my house and that no one was home.  He was lying out of his teeth.

I called him back and the phone call this morning went something like this.  You owe us $900 and if you pay by the end of the day it will we can settle at $700. 
If I couldn't he told me I was going to have to hire a lawyer and go to court in Seattle, WA (I live in NY). 

This guy from the collection agency was hassling me to pay as quick as I could and I told him I couldn't because I don't have the $700.

The collection agency is [Cory G. Hicks &amp; Associates](http://www.google.com/search?source=ig&amp;hl=en&amp;rlz=&amp;q=Cory+G.+H+%26+Associates&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;aq=f&amp;oq=#hl=en&amp;expIds=17050,25657,26486,26488,26492,26496,26504,27339,27642,27887,27951&amp;sugexp=ldymls&amp;xhr=t&amp;q=%22Cory+G.+Hicks+%26+Associates%22&amp;cp=14&amp;pf=p&amp;sclient=psy&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=&amp;aql=&amp;oq=%22Cory+G.+Hicks+%26+Associates%22&amp;gs_rfai=&amp;pbx=1&amp;fp=ca05a7bb65e82229) and after googling them you’ll come to find out that they aren’t best of people.  They use scare tactics and extortion in order for people to pay them.

I want to refrain from posting the Server Hosting company but I might if some wants to know.

Could anyone offer me some advice on what to do.  My dad has lawyers and can fight this but I want to know for sure that if I was going to court I would win.  I'm a bit scared because of the off chance the Judge sides with the collection agency. I'm a broke ass kid without much money and would hate to be furthur in debt.

**TL;DR** I was hosting a server on a company, and canceled my services with the company over the phone.  A few months later a company buys out that company and continues to bill me for $184 without me knowing for **5 months**.  I got a voicemail this morning from a collection agency asking for $900 to pay them back. Advice???

**Things I do exceptionally well:**

* Computers: My first experience with a computer was trying to fix our broken down IBM 386 with Windows 3.11 on it. I've used Linux since I was 14 (I am 28 now), and I feel that I know it pretty in-depth. I also program in Perl, Python, PHP, C/C++, and Java.

* Music: I know more bands than most people have ever even heard.

* Literature: I am constantly reading, and have read so many books I would definitely look like a forever alone type of character (if not for my wife and son).

* Writing: I have never shared any of my writing with anyone, but I have written a lot of short stories, and I feel that they are worth reading. It is something that I really enjoy, but I am constantly faced with writers block, so it's not something I do a lot of.

* Beer: I was drinking micros at the age of 14. When everyone was bringing Natty Light to the parties, I would show up with a 6 pack of Black Star. I've had so many beers it's insane.

* Cooking: I love cooking because it is something I do sheerly for the compliments, and I get them when I cook. Friends always ask me what ingredients I think could make their dish better, and I secretly revel in the fact that they look to me as an authority on cooking. I have no training, but for some reason I just seem to know what flavors go together. I was really into that show Chopped for a while, and I started buying odd ingredients and trying to make things; surprisingly, a lot of the dishes turned out really well.

**Things I really wish I knew:**

* Foreign Language: I've taken classes in French, Japanese, and Spanish. I even grew up in a bi-lingual household (Spanish and English), and yet I still only speak English. I am going back to school, so I promised myself that I am going to take at least two years of Korean.

* The guitar: I have bought and sold so many guitars over the years that I have finally come to realize it is something I will never really dedicate myself to, and therefore I have promised myself not to buy a guitar ever again. I'd love to learn it, but it's just so damn difficult to do so for me. What's really sad is that I come from a very musical family, and they all seem to have a natural talent for it.

* Wine: I love wine, but I really don't know a lot about it. I have had a lot of different wines, but I still can't differentiate flavors, or really understand the complexities of it.

* Art: I can appreciate art, and I feel that I know a good amount about art, but for the life of me I can't draw even the simplest thing. I've tried throughout the years to get better, but I just do not have the talent for it.",-1,-1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,-1,-1,-1,0,-1,-1,0,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,-1,-1,-1,0,-1,-1,0,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1

As a child I developed a tendency towards acts of extreme cruelty however developed a belief that goodness is something to strive towards.

I fear death more than anything else, so suicide has never really been an option (though in truth I have tried through acts of wanton disregard and when thoroughly inebriated).

I despise restriction and rebel against convention and authority at every opportunity (however on occasion will encourage others in the development of regulation and structure).

I have been depressed for years and finally got diagnosed in college. Most of my friends know but I haven't told my family. Most days are about even, I go about my day like tralalalala and then I sleep. Some days I feel so giddy and happy I just want to dance and be with my friends. Others are much, much darker, I stay in my room, play games, watch tv and smoke weed (it numbs the pain). I can do this for days and even weeks without much movement. 
I also get awful insomnia when I'm depressed. Last semester of last year I broke up with my girlfriend and failed my exams. I failed the whole year and my parents think I was just being lazy. IDK I just can't bear telling them, as if it is admitting something shameful to them. I spent my time staying up and doing nothing really, I got to 4 or so days before I passed out on my bed.
Currently I have no job, I am living with my parents, I have so much college I fear I may fail and drop out but the fear is paralysing me from working as hard as I'd like (When I get some huge deadline or project I run from it like fight or flight reaction), so that makes me a coward, I am so lonely I feel like crying (I push it deep down which I've been told is really bad), I have no discernible skills or attributes and I'm ugly and weird.

This prompted me to do a google search for ""age of the ocean floor"".  For example [this page from about.com](http://geology.about.com/library/bl/maps/blseafloorage.htm) from a mainstream site portraying a mainstream point of view.  Shows the color coded diagram of the age of the ocean floor.
Oldest ocean floor is in blue, newest in red, with green and yellow in between.

The mainstream point of view is also stated at about.com saying that a large amount of the ocean floor is reycled.

Intuitively, the diagram didn't seem consistent with the recycled theory.  Then I decided to look at it in detail.  If the plates are expanding in the Atlantic, and being subducted in the Pacific, then one would expect the Pacific plates to be very old and the Atlantic ones to be very new.  But that is not the case.  They're both new.

There remains one last possibility.  That the subduction/ocean floor creation process alternates, first happening at one end, then going in the other direction.  This possibility can also be discounted because the newest ocean floor (red) is next to the medium age ocean floor (green,yellow), and farthest away from the oldest ocean floor. If the plates were going back and forth, the oldest part of the ocean floor would have to be right next to the some of the youngest without something in between.

In conclusion, just by looking at a widely available map of the ocean floor, its possible to conclude that the earth is expanding.  I was a bit shocked to learn this, and that the info would be so out in the open.

Of course, the also very interesting question:  where is the extra matter coming from?  Outer space?  Or is it being 'generated' somehow inside the earth, meaning there is no conservation of mass?

208161,"Since last year I'm having problems with my right eye.
It turns reddish (swollen veins in the eye) and shifting focus hurts (especially from and to reading distance). It always surges in from a side to the rest of the eye(it's red on one side first and a couple of hours later my whole eye is red). This lasts 1.5 day before it returns to normal. During all this I can see everything perfectly clear.

I have been to several eye-specialists (We have an eye-hospital in Rotterdam/Netherlands) and they really have no clue as to why and what.

In the beginning(started feb. 2009) it was a dead-on accurate cycle: once in two weeks starting friday and ending sunday. Lately the intervals are getting longer: I got it again today while the last time was around 8 november.

Ruled out:

- Infection or Conjunctivitis(most online diagnosis point to this one), they tested on several infections (even with a couple of bloodtests).

- Allergy. The specialist agreed that if it would manifest in one eye, it also would in the other.

- glaucoma

- high eye-pressure. Didn't knew it exists untill the test itself.

- Air humidity problems (I had gels to apply to avoid a dry eye)

- Dust

- Overstrained circular muscles. I once had to try and keep reading and shifting focus all day long in order to determine if it would prolong the interval. Nope, just 1.5 days.

I have:

- no glasses

- eye strength is around +0.5 both

- no diabetes

- no spiked bloodpressure

The docs are out of all options and plainly have no clue.
I recently returned, because I saw a deadpixel (black spot in my eyesight) in my righteye but it turned to be a proteine crystal which dissolves hopefully *in a couple of years*. 
When he saw it he rallied up some students and other docs to show it how it looks like (it's quite rare in younger people). The other docs immediately said:""Ah, you keep on bringing the mysteries with your righteye"".

I've read through [Coffee Geek](http://www.coffeegeek.com) and [Coffee Review](http://www.coffeereview.com). I've looked up local roasters and even read some articles on home roasting.



Through all of this, I have decided 2 things.
1. I want to drink awesome coffee at home. 
2. I don't want to be a coffee snob - it just costs too damn much!



I had a french press for a while, but had no clue how the hell to use it, and well it was kind of broken because I had gotten it at Salvation Army. I asked my hubby to fix it, which he did then I looked up [How to use a French Press](http://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+use+a+french+press&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a). Yesterday I made my first pot of french press coffee. It was wonderful!


I did a little bit more research into using a French Press, and found that the key to amazing French Press coffee is having a uniform course grind. The kind of grind you get from [a Burr Mill grinder](http://www.google.com/search?q=A+burr+mill+grinder&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a#q=A+burr+mill+grinder&amp;hl=en&amp;safe=active&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;hs=DDl&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;prmd=ivns&amp;source=univ&amp;tbs=shop:1&amp;tbo=u&amp;ei=PwwSTbbNOZKtngebh9mqDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=product_result_group&amp;ct=title&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CFIQrQQwAg&amp;biw=1258&amp;bih=425&amp;fp=9bef8cda26d1a6ec).

210552,"Looking in from the outside, our friends and family always held our relationship in such high regard. You could feel envy in some cases, for our relationship looked so perfect.  When together, we really glowed as a couple, even after such a long time together.  There was always something there that you didn't really see in other couples in a normal social setting.

A couple weeks ago, a sad truth was discovered.  A good friend since grade 7 had be caught by his girlfriend of 10 years.  She discovered some texts on his phone between him and my girlfriend.  It was all laid out in the texts.  They texted about how what they were doing was wrong, and they argued about it.  They had been cheating for a year and a half and the needed to end it.  I guess the guilt was starting to add up, but in twisted irony, the girlfriend found those messages, so it was ended in some unnatural fashion.

I was happy in my relationship, for the most part.  Considering the 13 years I felt strongly that what we had was what a long term relationship felt like.  You can't expect to live a full term relationship feeling like you did in the honeymoon stages.  I don't think that's quite possible.  I believe that love changes/morphes into something different. I never expected a long term relationship to be perfect.  I expected up and downs along the way.  And the downs were never really that bad.

Said asshole has always been a friend in our group, and my gf and him always got along over the years and we always did stuff together and sometimes they would hang out, or walk the dogs. I had felt so strongly that a friend could never do something like to another friend that I dismissed the idea of something going on.  I have friends of the opposite sex and I couldn't even imagine doing something like this to them.

Regardless, last summer they started to see other more often while ""walking the dog"" and their friendship slowly changed into something more emotional and physical. One weekend in July I had left for a vaction with some buddies (understanding only now perhaps why this guy couldn't go), and their relationship turned to sex.  From that point on they would secretly meet at night once or twice a month up until this past October.  It would happen when his girlfriend was working and I was out at one of my sports teams.

The situation is a bit of a mess.  Her and I JUST bought 2 condos this summer, after selling the house we lived in for 4 years.  One of the condos is a rental, and the other is where we were going to live.  So we had been living at her parents until our condo was to be ready this coming Feb or March. (btw, it confuses me so much that she could commit to such things when she was in this affair.)

So, I decided to just up and leave a few days after i heard the news.  I didn't tell her, i just packed the essentials and left.  She discovered eventually that night when i didn't come home.  I didn't have a place to go at first, but i eventually found a friend who has graciously taken me in until i get my condo in Feb/March.  I have not seen or talked to her on the phone since i left.   There has been a few emails in the beginning, but i've mostly ignored everything she's sent.

She's starting to realize how badly she fuct up.  I have access to her email and i can see the things she's writing.  She's starting to tell all of her close friends.  She's coming out with all the details, trying to get it all out so she can start over again on the right foot perhaps.

I've found out through her that she loved him during that time.  But she feels now that it's over, that she doesn't love him and that it wasn't real.  I've found out from one friend who talked with her that she couldn't understand why she felt like she could marry this guy, but didn't feel the same about me.  Was it because it was such a fresh new relationship that she felt so in love and wanting it so bad that she could?  I'm not really sure.  The honeymoon phase, the freshness can be powerful.

She's not trying to win me back right now. She's just trying to figure herself out I suppose.  Trying to understand what her real feelings are/were and find some confidence in the things she thinks she believes. I'm not part of that process, but I know it's what's she's going for.

So that brings me to the question I already know how each and every one of you will will reply.  Something along the lines of ""forget her... move on... find someone who really loves 100%... etc etc...""  I'm pretty numb to the whole situation still, and I haven't really come to terms with a complete decision on it, but I can tell you this.  I don't plan on trying to make it work any time soon.  I will move into my condo alone come Feb/March and that's the minimum time line for me before I figure out how I feel.   It largely depends on her I suppose.  What she can possibly do to mend what's broken, or to prove her worth.

I fear the day we are face to face again and the feeling I will find.  It could be one of anger, hate, sadness, or maybe one of love.  And we WILL have to be face to face again.  Most of my stuff is at her parents house.  We have these condos to deal with, etc etc.

I'm 32.  She's 31.  No kids.

My question:  Is long term love of this magnitude worth fighting for?  I know 95% of the time everyone will say NO, but I know there is still a crazy amount of love between the two of us.

210645,"Last night I was working a pretty busy night. There were three different tables who had fifteen or more guests (one of them had forty) and the cooks were cooking their food all at the same time. As a result, all of my dishes were coming out really late the whole night. One table's food was coming out especially late and I apologized multiple times and made sure I kept them coming with soup, salad and breadstick refills. When their food came out, I let the manager know that it was late and they might be upset, so he went and talked to them and said they were okay. When it came time for them to leave, they wrote a big zero in the tip field of the credit card receipt.

Naturally, I was pretty upset. I made it clear that it was through no fault of my own that their food was late and I provided the best service I could given the circumstances, and they thought it was appropriate to punish me.

210979,"Do you ever find yourself needing a container where you have a key inside the element?  

Say... something like this:

    struct Pos
    {
      int ID;
      double x, y;
    }

And you want the key to be ID.  Using a map would duplicate the key.  And using a set (either with custom comparison predicate or a less than operator in Pos) means you can't search by ID.  You can only search by the entire Pos structure where you would set the ID to search for.

I've recently released a skiplist container library and have added a new style container that acts like a map, but where you can define a custom accessor predicate to retrieve the key from the value.  It'd be something like this:

    struct PosAccess {
      int operator()(const Pos &amp;p) const {return p.ID;}
    }
    
    AccessSkipList&lt;int,Pos,PosAccess&gt; PosList;

So now the element is Pos type, but the key is Pos::ID.

I can't be the only one who runs into this all the time, am I?  What are your solutions when the key is also in the element itself?  I'm talking about times when you can't remove the key from the element.  My library aside, would you find a container that works in such a way to be useful?

This also goes for those who those who hate the idea of a national health care system. These people are wrong ( I believe) but they are also totally obstinate and have been successful in keeping us from achieving any progress.  I propose that we allow these people off the hook, or at least give them the same tax breaks and welfare that we would allow for any disabled person. Although it would cost those of us who understand the need for progressive taxes and strong social safety nets more money, in exchange we would secure the ability to enact strong programs that would benefit society as a whole. As an added bonus, we could could all give all our conservative relatives a lot of shit about what a drain they are on society when we are visiting for Thanksgiving dinner. 

TLDR; Modern day pirates on the high seas have shown us that in reality, sometimes it's more efficient to just pay the hostage takers and get on with business. I propose we ""pay off"" conservatives who hate liberal ideas in the same way so we can get on with the business of building a better society. 

EDIT: Here's one way to possibly achieve something approaching this proposal. Have a national referendum where Americans are asked to opt in to a ""patriot tax"" or ""social program tax"". This would be sort of like a national fundraiser for social programs. Say you wanted to enact a national health care system that would cost X amount of dollars. Americans could be asked to opt in to pay a little extra in their taxes to pay for it. You could cap the amount paid in at some reasonable rate. If enough people opted in to cover the programs' costs, the program could move forward. If the threshold does not get reached then the tax is not enacted and the program does not move forward.   I am just throwing ideas out here.  Say the program is a huge success, more people might decide to do the right thing and opt in. Those who opt out but utilize the programs WOULD be bloodsucking on our awesome system but that would just be something we'd have to be willing to live with. 

EDIT: I'm realizing that it's probably not a good idea to go about this by calling people who opted out to be mentally disabled. The fact is we have an immense divide in this country over how taxes should work and what they should accomplish. I'm proposing that we start looking for ideas and proposals for our tax system that addresses the divide and try to come up with something that everyone could agree on. If the conservative position is ""I don't want to pay any taxes for social programs"" and there's no practical way to let them opt out without letting them enjoy the benefits, then maybe those of us who want social programs have to prove how much we want them by being willing even to pay for those who don't.

* Seagate Barracuda 7200.12 ST31000528AS 1TB 7200 RPM SATA 3.0Gb/s 3.5"" Internal Hard Drive -Bare Drive.  **All the above for 282$**
* APEVIA Black SECC Steel / Aluminum X-MASTER-BK/500 ATX Media Center / HTPC Case - **25$ (after MIR).**
* IOGEAR GKM561R Black 2.4GHz Wireless HTPC Multimedia Keyboard with Laser Trackball and Scroll Wheel - **25$  (after MIR)**
* Corsair VX450W 450W Power Supply - **40$ (after MIR)**

The above cost me (if I get all the MIR) **372$**

What I need to buy yet:
* Windows 7 (approx 100 $)
* Blu-Ray drive (around 50$)

I submitted a post last night saying I'm in need of some $$ and I would design/code a website or something for those $$. I feel ashamed for asking like that. Anyways I sat down earlier and crunched some numbers and the only solution I saw was to apply for a loan which I did. So I'm holding my fingers(you say that right?) hoping my request will get approved. Now I don't really believe in karma and all that but here goes nothing:

**Is there anyone out there who would like me to help them out with some webdesign/developing for FREE?**

As I mentioned in my other post I'm not professional as its just a hobby and I don't really have a real portfolio.

But I've still got some older stuff ive worked on online:

*1 [Accursedfarms.com](http://www.accursedfarms.com/2010/08/) 
I helped the owner of accursedfarms out a lot with his old site. And im in no way linked to the current version of the website. But if you lurk you will find that im mention on that post.

*2 [Hotelvanilla.com](http://hotellvanilla.com)
I once freelanced for someone who I think is the biggest internet noob in the history. But then again he did have a company that did webdesign. I did not design that website but I did write 100% of all of the code including an admin interface.

*3 [loftaanlillesjon.se](http://www.loftaanlillesjon.se/fangstrapport.php)
I did the code and the design for this database rapport of the fish caught by the organisation complete with an admin interface.

*4 [vapid.se](http://vapid.se/)
A website me and a friend worked on while I was teaching him how to make websites. I did 80% of the design and 80% of the code. Though we never finished it since he moved on to a new project once he got the hang of it.

Right so if you need any help what so ever just contact me; I spend all day studying(currently mandarin &amp; some class about asia) and at the end of the day I want to do something I think is fun. I'm currently pretty much snowed in so I prefer to stay indoors as its currently -11°C outside. So i just end up spending all my time in front of the computer since I study online and when i'm done for the day I just browse reddit or watch cats dance on youtube.

Production: James used Logic 9, his M-Audio Firewire interface, an AKG C1000s and a matched pair of AKG C414B-ULS mics. Synths were done on a Korg R3. Vocals were recorded through the C1000s (strange choice, I know, but it suits Pow's voice) and a tube pre-amp. Acoustic also went through tube pre-amp. Mixing was done using headphones, so its not exactly spot on.

213364,"I Firstly, I think I first have to state that I don't believe in a God, however I hate calling myself atheist. My impression over the internet is that people subscribing to atheism believe there is NO God. They revel in their own rationality and logical mind without realizing that the statement ""there is no God"", shows just as much misguided faith as the statement ""there is a God"". 

The logical mind finds it very hard to come to the conclusion that supernatural entities exist due to the lack of scientific evidence. I do, however, challenge any poster here to explain their existence, or even some of the scientific 'fact; that they rely so heavily upon. The fact is we [the scientific community] do not know WHY or even HOW we are here. Where did we come from? What will happen to my consciousness when I [my body] die? Why is gravity as weak as it is? What created the fundamental laws that govern our universe?

The fact that believers attribute these to a God, is why - I believe - most atheists become atheists. They see the lack of logic or understanding in becoming a believer, and instantly say there is no evidence so there can't be a God. But since there are still fairly profound unanswered questions, this is just as unreasonable.

Until science HAS provided all of the answers to life, the universe and everything then Atheism is just as much a religion as Christianity or Islam. Atheism still displays a belief system, because of the unanswered questions - which is the illogical statement that makes atheists feel superior to believers.

Am I the only one who thinks she didn't die at the end?  

The entire film seems to me to be a metaphor for growing up.  Nina must find joy in what she's doing for herself - not her mom, not anyone else.  She has to get out of her sheltered child-like mindset and live her life and grow into a woman.  This is exemplified by the transformation into the Black Swan.  She is stepping out from underneath her mother's shelter and control and becoming her own person.  She is becoming a woman.  The transformation is complete by the end of the film. 

Also, the movie works as a metaphor for being an artist and creating art.  She has to find what is beautiful and meaningful for her.  She throws herself into her work so strongly that it affects her life outside of the performance (Heath Ledger?).  

I thought the film worked as a narrative within the film, but also on greater levels (like the two I just mentioned).  For this reason I find it to be one of the best films of the year.  This is how I interpreted the movie as I was watching it, so I was fascinated to discover upon reading others' reactions that so many people are on the ""she died at the end"" side of the fence.

The only things that I remember about it was that it was a classic (~40s or 50s, I would think), I'm pretty sure it was black and white.  It started out as a gangster film but somehow segued into an espionage/spy movie.

I remember thinking it was interesting and I thought the title had 'bullets' in it but I didn't have any lucking that right movie with that title.  I am pretty sure that there is some kind of plot that involves Gangsters helping the CIA capture some spys and there is some scene towards the end that involves a submarine.

I also cannot remember if there was anybody famous in it.  I would imagine that there was.

I apologize for being so vague but it is precisely because I can't remember much about it that i am so desperate to find it and watch it again.

It isn't:
 - Bullets over broadway
 - Bullets or Ballots
 
I don't THINK it is Bullet for Joey, but I am not sure.

215037,"I used to suffer from depression and I found myself visiting here quite a bit, either making posts myself or looking at others to remind myself I wasn't alone.
A year ago I was miserable and discontent with life. I ending up making a lot of mistakes and cheated on my long term girlfriend who I loved dearly, broke up, and fell into a pit of what seemed like never ending sadness and self pity. Thoughts of killing myself were triggered by the tiniest of things and I cried so hard because I felt taking my own life was inevitable. I had no one I could talk to, no social life, and I spent hours and hours lying on my bedroom floor, or in my shower just hoping I could summon the courage to put an end to my suffering. 

Over the past quarter I haven't visited r/depression or SW at all because I haven't needed to. I'm a very different person now. So I was just thinking about how far I'd come and just wanted to leave a message to anyone in a similar position to how I was.

Have hope, because there is a cure for your depression, you just have to find it.
It maybe a case of just waiting for your life to change, or it may require you to take more active steps.

I had counselling, and I was on meds, I tried jogging and cycling, and drawing, and writing my feelings down. None of these were the cure by themselves. Perhaps it was the combination, perhaps it was none of them, or perhaps it was just time. 

Whatever, just please don't give up on yourself and take the easy way out as I was far too tempted to. 
If you are feeling anything like how I felt, then you're probably not convinced. I don't blame you. But you're just going have to trust me on this.

Anyway, that's all I have to say. It's not as articulate as I'd like, but I've always had trouble expressing my thoughts.

215952,"I still have a residence in BC and I have my car in zone ""Z"", meaning it's insured for out-of-province use. I recently decided to plate it and insure it in Quebec to save a bunch of money. As you may or may not know, you have to put winter tires on your Quebec-plated car or face huge (like $500) fines. It's very controversial.

When I cross the border, the Americans always comment to be about that law. They absolutely can't believe it. They all know about it and think it's sheer communism. It's hard to explain the mentality of the Quebecois as a whole, but while they are cheap and don't want to buy winter tires, they'll put up with it. Is everyone convinced this a good thing? No. But since no one in Quebec with a car is starving, it's like another tax. People find a way to pay for it.

I put my winter wheels and tires on my car today. I have them on my other one as well. It was my choice to do so, I just thought it was the prudent thing to do. So there's no real hurdle for me to overcome to do this, though the American in me thinks (or thought) that this law was overkill. Now I think we should do it in every province, maybe even BC.

Here's an interesting problem. Twice today I heard someone say you needed winter tires to drive in Quebec. One was here on reddit in a different thread. That's not true. You need winter tires if you have a car plated in Quebec.

The second place was more disconcerting. I was at Sears in the US and a guy was selling tires, telling people to buy winter ones ""So you can go up to Quebec"" and the people lamented that it was too much and they just wouldn't be visiting Quebec this winter.

I wonder if it's occurred to anyone in government that for tourism, we need to make sure that Americans understand that the only ones who are required by law to have winter tires are those who own Quebec-plated vehicles. How many people willing to come and spend money in our country have decided against it because of this misconception? I've heard it mentioned twice in one day. This guy at Sears (and who knows how many other of his colleagues) are misinforming potential tourists left and right!

At this point, I thought that perhaps this law was a bad thing. But my new winter tires saved two lives today. And this is why we should do it.

I was coming up A-15 past La Prarie, right when you start to enter the metro Montreal area. I was in the centre lane going 105 and this guy passes me on the inside lane, doing about 120-130. There are disabled cars on the shoulder and he makes a break for them. Two guys are standing in the outside lane, waving him in. And then he loses control and starts to skid.

And spin.

And go right at the two dudes in the middle of the freeway. He bounces off one of their cars, airbags deploy and by the grace of god manages to not plow them down. But he's halfway in my lane and the two guys are still there. If I hit the car, it would shut like a door, squashing those two guys.

I just slam on my brakes and try to keep my lane. My winter tires? Stopped me. My old tires would have skidded me right into the accident, especially as it was a curve. I couldn't have swerved around, I would have lost control. I was able to stop in time.

As a side note, no one was hurt except the pride of the guy who hit his friend's car and the original guy they were trying to help who went off the embankment.

Anyway, I spent $800 and I saved myself almost that from my deductible. I saved two lives at the most and at least a bunch of money that the province would have paid for their care...plus the guy in the car who was overspeeding would have been t-boned after his airbags had deployed. Not good, either.

Do these tires prevent accidents? Absolutely. I saved our insurance and our province a lot of money by doing our part. Maybe my liberties have been curtailed by having to spend this money, but not as much as the liberty to walk or even live, like these guys now enjoy. I am happy to have spent this money on tires instead of Christmas gifts. In fact, I'd say my Christmas gift to a couple of strangers was not hitting them with their friend's car in a chain reaction.

tl;dr - we should make winter tires mandatory in every province from December to March. Offer a tax credit if you have to.

I understand there need to be restrictions on when people should be allowed certain things, but 21?! That's absurd.  The difference in maturity level from 19 to 21 isn't that large compared to say 17 to 19.

Now he states he was horrible and would do anything to change his actions. I feel that anyone that would truly love me would not do something this intentionally cruel and I am better off without him. I was friends with him for 13 years and dating for 9 months. 

Tomorrow he is showing up at my house with my belongings. I am very worried about how it is going to turn out. He wants to get back together desperately. I do not see how he will not betray me again in the future. 
This is the 3rd time he dumped me via text and we are middle age adults. Needless to say I am exhausted, hurt, and heartbroken from this whole ordeal and don't possess the strength to fight in person.

There is a little more to the story and I have also a work contract with him. Now I won't be finishing the project or getting paid after putting months in already. Part of me really just wants to finish this project and end the relationship but they are hand in hand at this point.

But the truth is the exact opposite, for all the people I have known and met in the anime scene are intelligent, fun and take care of how they look and work hard for their future and dreams. They are extremely successful, talented and more social than any regular folk I have known in my life.

The bad reputation that anime fans have of being failures and socially awkward have made the majority of people who are not into anime look at anime and its fans as failures. That's why every time I tell someone that I'm into anime they give me the look of disapproval, and I dislike that.

You can't be an anime fan without being judged and looked at like a freak by the majority of society. It's not my problem and neither is it any anime fans' problem that some people who are into anime ended up being failures and freaks.

Personally, I'm not a fan of outing anyone, even if they are a bigoted piece of shit.  Even if they are someone who is obviously gay.  Coming out is an incredibly personal thing to do, and in this world it is still something that not everyone is comfortable doing.

Before I came out, I would have been mortified if anyone had outed me, if anyone had drug me out of the closet.  I wish that the world was more understanding and that people felt more empowered to be who they really are in an open manner.  But we have a ways to go before that happens.

Like I said, I view coming out as a very personal thing to do.  It is huge, it is a massive thing for someone to do.  It has to do with their sense of identity, and that is up for the individual to decide, not other people.

I am only in charge of my life.  I am not and cannot be in charge of yours.  I cannot be the one that deals with the consequences of you being out of the closet, that is something that only you can deal with.  I think that if someone isn't ready to be out yet, then they shouldn't be forced to be out.  But I can work to make the world a better and more understanding place, and I can be and advocate for all LGBTQ people everywhere and hopefully empower them to be able to make that decision in their life.

Only he didn't. 

Once again he is healing. He is doing his duty and filling the gaping vacuum of healers currently present in Azeroth. 

Sure we was able to level as Enh. He enjoyed it immensely. For some reason he just can't stay DPS

When he was 10 he dreamed of crushing his enemies with mighty hammers. At 42 (due to a patch that left him talentless) he began his journey as a healer. His success at healing in TBC was quite impressive.

All the while though inside he had the gnawing feeling he had missed out on his true purpose.

Lich King came and again he grabbed a weapon in each hand and swung his way to level 80! Alas, the siren call of healing began again to call his name.

Resist as he might he couldn't deny that his path down the road of a healer was the right thing to do and he put his weapons of war to rest once again.

At this point you may be able to guess his current plight now that the Cataclysm has arrived.

We're doing pretty good, lux buys some wards for Twitch, i take some cleavers from Mundo for her and we're almost taking their tower down when things start going wrong. Our last pick, a Heimer (the other team was Panth, TF, Mundo, Twitch, MF) starts dieing a couple of times.

There are two methods to how this locator works.

The first R4R works like r/trees’ CommunityWalk map model which is a lot easier than posting constantly on R4R in my opinion. 

I created our own R4R map. 


* Add your location and username to the map, add [M] or [F] and any other information, find friends around you, send PM's and get out and have fun together! &lt;3

Here's the link. The username is ""R4R"" and the password is ""reddit"" Happy meetups!

* Second method.

Instructions: Create a reply-chain down to where you live, then reply to the city you live in with a ""here"", ""sup"", or whatever message.

**EXAMPLE:**

&gt;North America
&gt;&gt;Canada
&gt;&gt;&gt;Ontario
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Sudbury
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;sup

**DO NOT:**

* Upvote your city. The point is to let people know you're there so you can meet friends.

* Repost your city if it's already there. Reply to the city with a ""sup"", or ""I'm here"".

But I'm no doctor, and I'm going to see him in 2 hours, so I figure I'll find out soon enough.

At the doctor, I was pretty much able to do all of his tests (hands above head, hands on back of head, hands behind back) with only a little pain at the extreme of the movement.  His thoughts:  Most likely, the tendon that connects the muscle in the back of my shoulder to the front of the shoulder popped out of the groove it sits in, and in the morning I popped it back in.  Sorry for not being better with the names, I think it was a supra-something?  Anyways, he said there will be some lingering pain, but as long as the pain slowly goes away and doesn't get worse, there is no need for an MRI at the moment.  He gave me some info on rotator cuff injuries (in case it is more than just a displaced tendon), and exercises to help strengthen my shoulder.  He also said to give it a little time off, but there is no reason to stop lifting for a long time.  He recommended I cut the weight in half for any exercise where my arms are lifted up and away from my body, and build it up more slowly.  In fact, strengthening the shoulder area is what I need to do most, so as long as I take it slow, I should be able to avoid this injury in the future.

Thanks all for the diagnosis.  He said that if I wouldn't have been able to do the tests, he would have thought rotator cuff as well, and ordered an MRI.

Every time I talk to a Mac user on reddit, I get into an argument that usually ends with a blubbering and butt-hurt Mac user telling me to stop being an asshole.

I also get down-voted by Mac users for correcting misconceptions about things like the importance of W3C compliance and how it's not a ""browser bug"" just because Safari renders it right and Firefox doesn't.

So, until I figure out the intricacies of the emotionally sensitive mind of the average Mac user, I will keep my asshole-ish, RTFM-advocate, my-OS-is-better-than-yours-because-yours-is-a-stripped-down-version-of-my-firewall-OS opinions to myself.  :-P

He sustained a brain injury called Kernicterus and has visual (cortical visual impairment) and hearing (audio neuropathy) problems and Cerebral Palsy -- and it was completely preventable. Kernicterus was largely thought to have been eradicated in the 1970s but has made a steady comeback in recent years due to less vigilance when it comes to managing Jaundice. 

My wife and I are trying to put the dangers of Jaundice into public view and we're raising funds to hopefully push forward research for his plight. There are several clinical trials underway and several that could be done regarding allogenic/autologous stem-cells, and cord blood that could not only help with Cerebral Palsy, but also have far reaching effects with other illnesses. We are also attempting to purchase a Hyperbarric Chamber which has been used for treatment in those with CP. If this story could somehow wind up on the Yahoo! front page, I will forever love the party who orchestrates it.

Also, I call him Phobot because he is a 4th generation Vietnamese and African American. (Pho, Fo...it's funny to me...)

I'm looking for a book that's not overly intellectual, engaging, and preferably under 300 pages. Also keep in mind that this is a book for a middle aged woman, so no action-adventure/sci-fi stuff please.

222758,"I have tried and tried to accept this game. And I have tried and tried to bend over backwards to find some reason to like it. Thing is: it just doesn't sit right with me.

- I'm running along and I die because some douchebag feels that his E-peen will explode if he camps enough to earn himself a 2.0 KDR, even though it means shit to anyone with two braincells to rub together. Seriously, the amount of times I have been killed by random ADS campers is just sickening. And what's worse: Many Youtube commentators are actually cultivating this camp-it-out strategy by posting videos of themselves hiding in buildings. I had one guy berate me over my KDR a couple of weeks ago. Straight away, I decided to check out his last played game. In it; he spent the ENTIRE GAME on a balcony. THE ENTIRE FUCKING GAME. His motion sensor was down and he actually ADS camped until he could earn his chopper gunner. I felt a bit sick.

- I was playing SnD today on Radiation and I was left against one other player. I shot him and he dropped into Second Chance. He shot me once or twice so I stepped behind cover. 3-4 seconds later, after recovering, I stepped back out again to finish off the round and B-BANG, I was dead. This guy shot me with his pistol twice (at most) and killed me.

- Every now and again, whenever I seem to get into a gun fight, it feels as if the FPS drop and I lose out to lag. I'm running along, noticing no connection issues and then BANG, the guy infront of me is teleporting and I've just been killed.

I feel that lately, I just don't care about the game. I just run around doing stupid things, not caring about my score. Thing is: I was never like that with MW2.

I've recently started learning Ada and want an in-depth reference book that covers not just the latest version of the language but the standard libraries. I've been programming in languages like Python, PHP, Pascal, Java, and C for a good many years so I don't need a beginner book. I want something that covers things like string processing, unicode, xml, interfacing to GUIs like GTK, networking and sockets, and so on. 

I did some searching inside this book and found no mention of regular expressions, for example, and only one mention of xml. Searches for GTK, or GUI, return nothing. I am unsure whether this is because these things are not covered or whether the search on Amazon sucks.

So, do you think this is a good reference book. If not, are there any that you would especially recommend? I've started reading [The Big Book of Linux Ada Programming](http://www.pegasoft.ca/resources/boblap/toc.html) which, while interesting, has lots of incomplete sections or sections which are not written at all.

I have a rule. Tell me the rules and as long as they are equitable and just, I'll play by them. Don't tell me the rules and as far as I'm concerned you are allowed to make them up as you go along. In college people would chastise me for  not cutting across the grass, when the signs clearly said, ""Stay off the Grass""

I understood that if everybody walked on the grass, there would be no grass. I like grass. I appreciate that people work hard for very little money to make it look good. So I don't walk on it, when I am asked not to.

But nobody has told me the rules for ATMs. I just got ""chastised"" by the golfing guy in sunglasses. I'm at the Mall. I drive over the ATM. The parking lot is full, cars everywhere. In close proximity to the ATM is a mail box and a little farther away is a bank.

There is one guy getting money and cars sitting at a distance from the ATM like plastic hyenas.

I don't know who is coming, who is leaving, who is using the mail box, who is on their lunch break from the Mall, who is getting a hand job from a local hooker, who is on their cell, who is having a suicidal Christmas crying jag and who is getting money. So I figure, I'll do the thing I came here to do, get money.

As soon as the man in front of me leaves, I step up to the machine. Mr. Golf Outing gets out of his car and yells sarcastically: ""You do realize we were all in line for that machine?""

I turned and replied: ""No, I'm the only person who was in line.""

He said: ""People don't like it when you stand behind them when they are getting money. Everybody knows that.""  Luckily I refrained from saying the first thing that popped into my mind which was *Unless they are close enough to check my prostate, I don't tend to mind.* and settled for the second thing instead, which was: ""What I know is, if you are too lazy to stand out in the cold, it's not my problem."" It was a frigid 50 degrees out.

""OH MERRY CHRISTMAS"" he shouted out sarcastically.

Inner voice *That's some way to show the spirit of the season, jackass.*

By this time, people had indeed started to form a queue. One of the young ladies behind me took up Mr. Golf Outing's goodwill of the season and repeated his holiday greeting, with only a little less snark ""Merry Christmas, I hope you have a good one."" And I replied, in all sincerity, ""Thank you, I hope you do too.""

By this time I had completed my business. I turned and walked back to my car.

Mr. Golf Outing said, ""Karma's a bitch."" Inner voice * Your chest beating is not impressive. If you grab a tree limb and started running through a stream, it could be more effective.... but prolly not.* (the problem with dealing with some folks is that primate anthropological references are often lost on them)

I turned to him and said, ""That actually comes closer to my religious beliefs than Christianity.""

This set his on his heels, because after that , he just kept saying things like, ""Yeah, Karma."" ""Karma will take care of you.""

Seems his knowledge of the non-Christian religions, is at least on par with his knowledge of the one he professes to follow.

So, all you polite people. Would you sit in a car and wait for an indeterminate number of people to lumber out of their cars up to the cash machine, back to their cars and do it all over again for the next 5 people? Or would you get out of your car, get in line and  then if someone moved up to the queue and politely  pointed out that they were there first,  gladly move out of the way?

There was no major stigma at my high school if you had lost your virginity (and even some stigma if you hadn't by the end of Senior year) and we were fairly well educated about contraception.

For some reason it just seemed like all nearly all the kids who stayed in the area have ended up in very serious relationships by their early twenties, as in living together twelve months and making long term plans for marriage and children. Of course you'd expect that from a minority, but I would seriously estimate 80% of the people my age are in some sort of commitment.

Now I'm not having a go at that sort of lifestyle; I myself would love to settle down and have a family eventually, but it's more something that I'm planning a decade from now, when I'm actually financially and emotionally for marriage and kids. The few bad relationships I've had at this age have let me realise that I'm really not mature enough yet for a life time commitment with anyone. Frankly, unless I'm completely swept off my feet, I can't see myself married until I'm at least thirty and have had plenty of experiences to let me know if I've found the right one.

The only thing is, I thought that in this day and age that was the norm. It's kind of weird receiving wedding invitations from high school friends.

But, in high school (before I went to college), I had really negative opinions about people who joined the military.  They haven't been totally dispelled since I've known more military people.  They have, in fact, been confirmed. 

So.....my husband is great.  As I mentioned, some other men and their wives are great.  I'm not talking about every military person.  There are some fantastic, intelligent people in the service.

But, (and here is the non-politically correct part) lots of them are complete idiots.  They have no idea why our country is even at war.  They don't know the objective.  They know they have a job to do and that's all. 

I don't expect them to be scholars --- but they have NO idea what they're fighting for (they can't even make one coherent sentence about it).... no idea about the history of the area... no idea about the history of the world.

I do feel like some of them are rather worthless.  They had no common sense and that's how they were recruited.  If they hadn't been recruited, they'd be mindlessly working at a factory or selling drugs (we know a few who had the choice of going to prison or joining the military).

Anyway.....I think tons of people who don't know military guys thank them for their service and really respect them.  That's not a bad thing, I guess.  Some guys are great.  And, they have put their lives on the line.  Perhaps they all deserve respect for risking their lives.  But, like I said, but I've seen such horrible things too.

I've seen a guy attempt to strangle his girlfriend at a party at our house (all the guys stepped in to stop him from doing it), but still..... WHAT?  I have never seen anything close to that in civilian life.  

I've also seen married men talk down to their wives like they were dogs.  I think it has something to do with rank and how everyone percieves themselves to be above or below someone due to rank.  Wives have no rank.  That's the best explanation I can make out.  I've never observed people be so rude to their significant others (not just 1 or 2 guys, but many of them).

Anyway.... that's my opinion (and what I've experienced) with the military.

Say you extend your arm out horizontally, away from your face.  Your fingers are extended, and a fly has landed on your index finger.  Immediately, you feel that sensation.  You feel it, knowing exactly that it is roughly 3/4 of a meter away from your face and a 1 3/4 meter from the ground.  

Now, think of this in a 3 dimensional aspect, what gives this sensation it's physical location in the universe? How do I know that it is this certain distance from the ground and from my face.  If I have sat down on a chair in a typical room, and then blind folded my self, I would be able to visually imagine the stimulation's location within the world at a 3-Dimensional level.

224279,"As the title says, my brother and parent's bond is deteriorating. Just a little background:

I'm a 20 year old college student home for the holidays, and I am noticing some real cracks in their attitudes toward each other. 

My brother is an 18-year old senior in high school (America). He'll hopefully be graduating this may/june. His grades have never been very good, and this has always been a problem between them since 3rd grade. He consistently brings home less-than-stellar marks even now, and my parents are at their wits end. They love him and are doing the best they can, but I don't think that will be enough.

He hangs out with many individuals that even I think are ok, but my parents heavily stereotype them as drug users and a bad influence on him. Perhaps this has some merit, as they have found out a few months ago that he has been smoking cigarettes for a few years now.

Recently, he has found home life nearly intolerable, and tries to escape it whenever he has the chance. He told me earlier today that he correlates being around the family with getting into arguments, and he just can't deal with that anymore. Now they even accuse him of doing drugs because he wants out so much. I know for a FACT that he has never done any drugs other than cigarettes, and does not drink. He assures me with full conviction that that is one of the few morals he has kept.

The only future I see is that as soon as he graduates (or doesn't), he'll leave the house and cut all ties with my parents. I don't think he'll have the means to support himself, and I worry that the fine relationship our family always had will never be there again.

I proposed to my brother earlier today that perhaps we could have a sit-down between the two groups with me moderating, but I fear that this might not work.

Anyway, this story he sent me was an interesting one but I can't quite figure out a polite but appropriate way to respond to it:

---

A science professor begins his school year with a lecture to the students, ""Let me explain the problem science has with religion."" The atheist professor of philosophy pauses before his class and then asks one of his new students to stand.

""You're a Christian, aren't you, son?""

""Yes sir,"" the student says.

""So you believe in God?""

""Absolutely.""

""Is God good?""

""Sure! God's good.""

""Is God all-powerful? Can God do anything?""

""Yes.""

""Are you good or evil?""

""The Bible says I'm evil.""

The professor grins knowingly. ""Aha! The Bible!"" He considers for a moment. ""Here's one for you. Let's say there's a sick person over here and you can cure him. You can do it. Would you help him? Would you try?""

""Yes sir, I would.""

""So you're good...!""

""I wouldn't say that.""

""But why not say that? You'd help a sick and maimed person if you could. Most of us would if we could. But God doesn't.""

The student does not answer, so the professor continues. ""He doesn't, does he? My brother was a Christian who died of cancer, even though he prayed to Jesus to heal him. How is this Jesus good? Hmmm? Can you answer that one?""

The student remains silent.

""No, you can't, can you?"" the professor says. He takes a sip of water from a glass on his desk to give the student time to relax.

""Let's start again, young fella. Is God good?""

""Er...yes,"" the student says.

""Is Satan good?""

The student doesn't hesitate on this one. ""No.""

""Then where does Satan come from?""

The student falters. ""From God""

""That's right. God made Satan, didn't he? Tell me, son. Is there evil in this world?""

""Yes, sir.""

""Evil's everywhere, isn't it? And God did make everything, correct?""

""Yes.""

""So who created evil?"" The professor continued, ""If God created everything, then God created evil, since evil exists, and according to the principle that our works define who we are, then God is evil.""

Again, the student has no answer. ""Is there sickness? Immorality? Hatred? Ugliness? All these terrible things, do they exist in this world?""

The student squirms on his feet. ""Yes.""

""So who created them?""

The student does not answer again, so the professor repeats his question. ""Who created them?"" There is still no answer. Suddenly the lecturer breaks away to pace in front of the classroom. The class is mesmerized. ""Tell me,"" he continues onto another student. ""Do you believe in Jesus Christ, son?""

The student's voice betrays him and cracks. ""Yes, professor, I do.""

The old man stops pacing. ""Science says you have five senses you use to identify and observe the world around you. Have you ever seen Jesus?""

""No sir. I've never seen Him.""

""Then tell us if you've ever heard your Jesus?""

""No, sir, I have not.""

""Have you ever felt your Jesus, tasted your Jesus or smelt your Jesus? Have you ever had any sensory perception of Jesus Christ, or God for that matter?""

""No, sir, I'm afraid I haven't.""

""Yet you still believe in him?""

""Yes.""

""According to the rules of empirical, testable, demonstrable protocol, science says your God doesn't exist. What do you say to that, son?""

""Nothing,"" the student replies. ""I only have my faith.""

""Yes, faith,"" the professor repeats. ""And that is the problem science has with God. There is no evidence, only faith.""

The student stands quietly for a moment, before asking a question of His own. ""Professor, is there such thing as heat?""

""Yes,"" the professor replies. ""There's heat.""

""And is there such a thing as cold?""

""Yes, son, there's cold too.""

""No sir, there isn't.""

The professor turns to face the student, obviously interested. The room suddenly becomes very quiet. The student begins to explain. ""You can have lots of heat, even more heat, super-heat, mega-heat, unlimited heat, white heat, a little heat or no heat, but we don't have anything called 'cold'. We can hit up to 458 degrees below zero, which is no heat, but we can't go any further after that. There is no such thing as cold; otherwise we would be able to go colder than the lowest -458 degrees.""

""Every body or object is susceptible to study when it has or transmits energy, and heat is what makes a body or matter have or transmit energy. Absolute zero (-458 F) is the total absence of heat. You see, sir, cold is only a word we use to describe the absence of heat. We cannot measure cold. Heat we can measure in thermal units because heat is energy. Cold is not the opposite of heat, sir, just the absence of it.""

Silence across the room. A pen drops somewhere in the classroom, sounding like a hammer.

""What about darkness, professor. Is there such a thing as darkness?""

""Yes,"" the professor replies without hesitation. ""What is night if it isn't darkness?""

""You're wrong again, sir. Darkness is not something; it is the absence of something. You can have low light, normal light, bright light, flashing light, but if you have no light constantly you have nothing and it's called darkness, isn't it? That's the meaning we use to define the word.""

""In reality, darkness isn't. If it were, you would be able to make darkness darker, wouldn't you?""

The professor begins to smile at the student in front of him. This will be a good semester. ""So what point are you making, young man?""

""Yes, professor. My point is, your philosophical premise is flawed to start with, and so your conclusion must also be flawed.""

The professor's face cannot hide his surprise this time. ""Flawed? Can you explain how?""

""You are working on the premise of duality,"" the student explains. ""You argue that there is life and then there's death; a good God and a bad God. You are viewing the concept of God as something finite, something we can measure. Sir, science can't even explain a thought.""

""It uses electricity and magnetism, but has never seen, much less fully understood either one. To view death as the opposite of life is to be ignorant of the fact that death cannot exist as a substantive thing. Death is not the opposite of life, just the absence of it.""

""Now tell me, professor. Do you teach your students that they evolved from a monkey?""

""If you are referring to the natural evolutionary process, young man, yes, of course I do.""

""Have you ever observed evolution with your own eyes, sir?""

The professor begins to shake his head, still smiling, as he realizes where the argument is going. A very good semester, indeed.

""Since no one has ever observed the process of evolution at work and cannot even prove that this process is an on-going endeavor, are you not teaching your opinion, sir? Are you now not a scientist, but a preacher?""

The class is in uproar. The student remains silent until the commotion has subsided.

""To continue the point you were making earlier to the other student, let me give you an example of what I mean.""

The student looks around the room. ""Is there anyone in the class who has ever seen the professor's brain?"" The class breaks out into laughter.

""Is there anyone here who has ever heard the professor's brain, felt the professor's brain, touched or smelt the professor's brain? No one appears to have done so. So, according to the established rules of empirical, stable, demonstrable protocol, science says that you have no brain, with all due respect, sir.""

""So if science says you have no brain, how can we trust your lectures, sir?""

Now the room is silent. The professor just stares at the student, his face unreadable.

Finally, after what seems an eternity, the old man answers. ""I guess you'll have to take them on faith.""

""Now, you accept that there is faith, and, in fact, faith exists with life,"" the student continues. ""Now, sir, is there such a thing as evil?""

Now uncertain, the professor responds, ""Of course, there is. We see it everyday. It is in the daily example of man's inhumanity to man. It is in the multitude of crime and violence everywhere in the world. These manifestations are nothing else but evil.""

To this the student replied, ""Evil does not exist sir, or at least it does not exist unto itself. Evil is simply the absence of God. It is just like darkness and cold, a word that man has created to describe the absence of God. God did not create evil. Evil is the result of what happens when man does not have God's love present in his heart. It's like the cold that comes when there is no heat or the darkness that comes when there is no light.""

The professor sat down.

225284,"Hey all,

Okay, I'm a 19-year-old guy. Here's some background: my best friend, for I have a thing, is going to be staying with me for two weeks over break, and for the entire summer. She's staying with me in my dorm this break, and we're getting an apartment over summer, as we're working together at a summer camp. We have known each other since we were 14, and haven't seen each other since we were 15, but kept very much in touch, through video chat, calls, IM, text, etc. I can count the number of nights on my fingers I haven't fallen asleep talkin on the phone with her. She is beautiful beyond words and imagination, brilliant, sweet, funny, a damn good cook, and fun to be around. Honestly, the girl of my dreams. She does reciprocate my affection, btw, but we won't get into a relationship just because of the distance (which sucks, but I understand)

So, I need your advice. How do I make her happy, sexually and emotionally? I want to treat her the way I see her. She is precious beyond all words to me- I was in a bad place when I was 17, and she talked me out of it and was the only light in my life for quite a while- and I want to show her that through my actions. I see her and have an immediate need to take care of her, and protect her (although I have a feeling she wouldn't take kindly to that- she's one of the most independent and self-sufficient women I've ever met). How do I show her I care?

Sexually, I have three questions: It's pretty much accepted that at some point in these two weeks, between our Halo and CoD tourneys, and her amazing cooking, and watching movies, we are going to have sex. Probably quite a lot of it. I'm a virgin. She's a virgin. First of all, I'm 6'8, and she's 5'3, so I have a feeling that will be a major issue. I'm also a pretty built guy, and even though she's fit, she's still only 110lbs. Secondly, I don't know how to foreplay, or make her happy at all, or how slow to take it but still make it so she doesn't get bored. Finally, I have no idea what the hell to do. Yea, I've watched porn. But I know that stuff isn't real, so I still have no idea. So how do I make this good and not painful for her? This can be the best two weeks of my life (how often does a dorky software engineering student have a smart, sexy girl move in with them for two weeks? All the time- in engineering student's dreams) and I want to make them good for her too.... so help?

**EDIT**: I also need some help for being with her in an everyday sort of way- she's going to be here for 2 weeks, and about all I can think of to do is play video games/ go to the library. This is because I am boring and have no life. ",-1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
225292,"Hi, so on my other rig which I built about 2 years ago, recently I could not startup. The fans come on, and originally it made one long, 2 short beep. According to the internet, this apparently means a problem with the graphics card. This sounds likely because I get no video. But beyond getting no video, I can't start up and get to BIOS like I usually do. After tinkering with the motherboard and some connections to make sure everything was still plugged in right, the ""beep"" went away, with all the fans running and power good, but still no startup.

I just wanted to ask to see if anybody had any suggestions before I bought a new graphics card.

More information: after removing the graphics card I blew a huge amount of dust out of the graphics card fan. I don't know if the dust somehow killed it, but the graphics card fan is still running. I imagine that is separate from whatever issue the card is having though.

The card is an XFX 8800 GT.

It's just that I've had my share of girlfriends, and I've had doubts about every single one. Until of course, I met this one. She's literally everything I've ever searched for in a woman. She's mature (albeit still growing and discovering herself), funny, intelligent, nerdy, and very cute. very. cute. For her, I'm one of the only people, even among her oldest friends, that understands her and knows what she's thinking even without her having to say it sometimes. She sees a future with me, and despite being very shy, not afraid to admit that she loves me and is willing to see this through together.

We have our share of obstacles. We're both asian, and i guess love and romance isn't really something either of our parents get. Her parents especially. She's not aloud to have guy friends, let alone date. There's distance as well. We're both from the Dallas/Ft. Worth area, but i have to go back to school in Georgia in a week, but i guess i can't do a very good job of taking care of her unless i finish my education and get a career going. Of course there will be more obstacles. However, despite all of this and more going against us, we've both found in each other something that we both know will be hard to find again, and appreciate what we have as something special. We talk things out as a team and we know that we'll just have to learn and figure things out as we go along.

We know it's a long shot, but we've made up our minds that it's worth the risk, and for the most part our main concerns are our ability to do our part in the relationship. We want to do a good job taking care of each other and we don't want to slack, but that's also something we've agreed to work through and compromise just like any other obstacles we may face. As happy as we are to have found each other, we know this will be work. Encouragement and advice would be really appreciated even if it's from total strangers. We know we are young, so it's natural for people (especially on her side) to be skeptical. They care about us and don't want us to make a mistake. We want to show them that we're not. :)

Reddit reminded me how much despair (and triumph through despair) there is out there.

I don't want to go into my past despair, the roots, etc.  Despair and loneliness are just what they are.  I just want to share the tools that I credit with getting me out of them.

If I had to break it down, I would say two things saved me from despair, depression, negative thinking:

1. Travel
2. Self-help/growth books


ONE-   I came from the suburbs of Bellingham, WA and from a very divided high school.  I had my mountain biking friends and we had a lot of great times, but I felt very isolated from the rest of the community.  I felt nervous around girls, couldn't bring myself to talk to them, didn't think they'd like me.  At times, it was worse than that, it was that feeling of: *no one gives a fuck about me.  I could dissapear*.  That's a horrible one, haven't felt it in a while.  But I'll tell you this: the emotion is hard to bring back.  I remember the sentence (semantic memory) of that feeling, but I can't bring the feeling back.

Traveling showed me that not everywhere functions like your home world.  I mowed lawns, washed dishes, made pizzas like mad and went to New Zealand with my buddy after graduating high school.  In the hostels there, I finally found that some women liked me, that people like me, that there exists worlds where people are far more inviting.  It changed a lot for me to see that.  Although that social heaven of hostels might be a temporary or unsustainable utopia, it gave me the sense that I was likeable and more worthy than I had imagined.  At 21, I moved to Bogota, Colombia for a year, and again, I found I was capable of establishing a community of good friends.  I started to realize that it wasn't a fluke.  I wanted to learn how to feel that in the US, eventually, with a lot of work, I did.

TWO- Self-help books/blogs
I mean a lot by this.  Books/blogs about buddhism.  Financial indepedence books.  Anything that helps you become more positive and responsible.  Blogs like [the art of non-conformity](http://chrisguillebeau.com/3x5/), [zen habits](http://zenhabits.net/), and [I will teach you to be rich](http://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/blog/consuming-vs-producing/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+IWillTeachYouToBeRich+%28I+Will+Teach+You+To+Be+Rich%29)...these taught me that there are sorts of ways we can learn to live, that you can take control of your experience.

Sure I still feel isolated or lonely at times (especially tonight)...but for those of you who are in the midst of horrible despair, please look for tools that can slowly get you out of that, it's not worth staying there.


**TL:DR**  It's hard to leave your past, your habitually desperate self.  It's hard to imagine a future without so much pain.  But please, be aware, there are a various tools that can help you get there.

edit: These tools helped me, but as a psychology student I have the duty to tell you that some depression needs more than cognitive changes, some of it requires biological treatments.  My tips here are basically in line with changing your behavior and cognitions but does not address the biological factors.

We broke up about 1.5 years ago because I'm an alcoholic. I quit drinking after she broke up with me, we got back together several months later. Right off the bat, the sex was different than from before the breakup. First of all, she never initiates, unless I make it clear I need it. Second of all, it's BORING! Missionary, flip her over, finish. 

I try to make it exciting. I go down on her (she hasn't blown me since we got back together 1.5 years ago) try to make her feel good, but I can tell she's not into it. She was never the horniest girl, but we used to have sex/fool around at least a couple times a week. Now I'm lucky if it's once a month. I've told her a couple times how I feel like more of a friend/family member than a boyfriend and that I wish things could be more intimate between us. She's great at cuddling and smooching me, but that makes me mad, because I feel like she gets satisfaction while I'm sitting there stewing in my own juices!

To make matters worse, we live together and have so much shit intertwined that even thinking about breaking about gives me a headache. I do want to make it work though, but I fear the sex life will only get worse in the future.  I understand that she's busy, and I'm less busy. She works full time and goes to school. But I know there are plenty of busy people out there that make there love life work.

How do I make it clear how important sex is to me without threatening to break up? I've tried telling her numerous times, after which we'll have sex (for those that don't know, guilt sex is terrible). 

I feel like if this matter was solved, nearly everything would be great. We love each other, we do anything for each other, make each other laugh, etc. But lately I've been really pissed off ALL the time around her, because my mind keeps going back to the fact that I haven't received any sexual advance from her in MONTHS!

What should I do?

Evolution 'fails on all counts'

To The Editor:

Nick Cormier got the definition down right; the problem is evolution doesn't seem to qualify.

In ""Correcting misinformation"" (Forum, Dec. 21) Mr. Cormier defines a scientific theory as ""a collection of observable phenomena described using quantifiable properties and expressed using laws."" Going from inert matter to humans is not observable, even though famous atheist Richard Dawkins says ""Evolution has been observed. It's just that it hasn't been observed while it's happening.""

Saying ""chance mutations"" did it is not using quantifiable properties or using any of the accepted laws of science as ""chance"" is not a creative force, and mutations are corruptions or mistakes, which degrade the genome. Evolution fails as a scientific theory on all counts.

None of this will slow down the acceptance of evolution as theory, or fact for that matter, as most academics agree with Richard Lewontin who said: ""We take the side of science (evolution) in spite of the patent absurdity of some of its constructs, in spite of its failure to fulfill many of its extravagant promises of health and life, in spite of the tolerance of the scientific community for unsubstantiated just-so stories, because we have a prior commitment, a commitment to materialism. It is not that the methods and institutions of science somehow compel us to accept a material explanation of the phenomenal world, but, on the contrary, that we are forced by our a priori adherence to material causes to create an apparatus of investigation and a set of concepts that produce material explanations, no matter how counter-intuitive, no matter how mystifying to the uninitiated. Moreover, that materialism is an absolute, for we cannot allow a Divine Foot in the door."" Evolution versus Divine Creation, the 'conversation' will no doubt continue!

227331,"On reddit, there seems to be an overwhelming consensus that telling your children that Santa exists is a crime against one's childhood. The main reasons behind that is that you shouldn't tell your children that supernatural beings exist because it might hinder their educational development, and the fact that Santa can be used as a bargaining chip to get children to behave throughout the year (or more likely, near Christmas time).

When I was growing up, my parents never used the ""Santa won't bring you anything special if you're naughty!"" excuse with me.  Like parents should, they disciplined me *themselves* when I did something wrong.  This is an idea I can get behind and I agree that the idea of Santa should not be presented in that way.

The rest of the idea of Santa, however, seems harmless to me.  I'm an atheist, and even I think a childhood of believing in something that doesn't exist isn't particularly harmful.  Children create imaginary friends all the time, and seems to be a natural part of their development.  Is it a real problem to have an imaginary friend that brings presents?

Finally, there seems to be contention that children are affected psychologically when they find out that Santa does not exist.  Myself, I figured it out when there were some obvious clues, such as the fact that Santa would use the same wrapping paper as my parents.  When I thought about many of the clues, I gradually lost my belief in Santa throughout ages 8 to 9 without any crying or yelling or what-have-you.

229631,Im trying to somehow connect the stereo headphone output jack on my computer directly into the microphone input on my cellphone. I like to record sound from movies &amp; such for my outgoing voicemail message but if I simply hold the microphone on the phone up to the speaker that quality is real bad. I was able to use a 3.5mm TRS stereo cable and connect it to the phone and computer but if I do that then my phone speakerphone shuts off because it assumes Im using a TRRS headphone/mic set and I cant hear the prompts from the voicemail system telling me to start recording and thus the timing is off.

I'll try to explain my thought process as impartially as possible and I hope people will trust that I'm asking this question in earnest and not provocatively. *Obviously because of the nature of the question and my evidence, very fundamentalist readers and I are going to be at an impasse and probably should not bother with a response, at least for the purpose of addressing me specifically*
-------------------------------------------------------------------

We are told that God has endowed man with free will, and the ability to choose whether we believe in him or not.

It is this free will that is pointed to as the reason why God is not to be regarded as cruel or unfair when we see plainly that in some cases he has created individuals who, for example, reject a belief in God. They willfully made their choice, and so they are accountable to only themselves for the consequences, right? It's nice and tidy.

My problem, however, is that I don't believe free will exists, which makes this a much more sticky question.

 A lot of my friends look at me funny when I say ""I don't believe in free will"", and they use justifications like how they picked out their wardrobe this morning and could have worn anything they wanted, or that they definitely chose what to have for breakfast as evidence that they have absolute free will to decide for themselves what they want or believe. The thought that we are not the captain of our own vessel is undoubtedly an unnerving one, and so I don't begrudge them for not being very warm to the idea. 

I don't believe in a ""Destiny"" in the romantic sense of the word, but I do believe that every moment is a incremental step, proceeding forward as a result of the previous moment, which has been happening since the beginning of the universe; A grand cosmic chain reaction, if you will. Physics and Chemistry are largely about causality; one thing bumps another and sends it shooting off this way, or X+Y yields Z. If you had a supernatural understanding of physics and could know all the possible variables--basically, if you had God's omniscience, It seems like you could know and predict how the entire universe would unfold in the same way that a lowly High Schooler in physics class can accurately predict the parabolic arc that a football will travel when kicked. I think this viewpoint is referred to as a ""deterministic universe"".

If we can explain cosmic phenomenon like how the stars work with chemistry, why not the human brain? We are, after all, made of stardust. The brain is a complicated organ which we are not anywhere close to having a comprehensive understanding of, but I think a reasonable and realistic person will have to admit that the wonder of human cognition, incredible as it is, ultimately is the sum result of the efforts of billions of smaller systems within the brain. The fundamental building blocks of the brain are something that we DO have some understanding of and can plainly see their mechanics. The hydrogen atoms incorporated into a neuron seem to be no different than the hydrogen found abundantly in the oceans.

This is a roundabout way of saying that the stuff of brains seems to have no special characteristic which sets it apart from all other observable matter. Knowing this, how can we say that human brains can avoid causality or the basic rules of physics and chemistry any more than a glass of water can choose to ignore fluid dynamics?

So then where do we get free will from? This is the point where, personally, I come to the conclusion that free will must not exist. The *illusion* of free will and our inner monologue is, however, absolutely convincing, and I think the question of why we have an inner monologue at all is a fascinating biological mystery. I am curious how religious people who maintain belief in free will might answer the question of where free will comes from, specifically in regards to the mechanics of the brain. Is there a metaphysical soul inside our brains, piloting the machine, and that is the impetus that supposedly frees us from the confines of causality?

Anyhow, continuing, the point of my musings on the brain comes to a crux here. 

Let's run an imaginary experiment. We sit a subject down and ask them to choose: tea or coffee? Maybe they pick the one that is sweeter, or the one they think is healthiest, or the one they *don't* want just to stick it to the experimenter and exercise their ""free will"", or maybe they have no clue why and pick one randomly. If we could rewind time and ask the same question again, would we get the same answer, every single time? Why wouldn't we get the same answer, if all the atoms and sub atomic particles and *everything* were put back exactly the same and the ""go"" button on the Rube Goldberg machine were pressed. There is no free will being exercised in this model at all, as far as I can tell.

So now that I've disproved free will (haha, to myself at least), where does this leave us with God?

It leaves us with a world where people can break every rule God has made for conducting a life on earth and they will be doing exactly what God had set them up to do from the beginning of the universe. What kind of God would knowingly create something a certain way and then punish it for its nature?

The inescapable conclusion is that, without free will, God is either unimaginably cruel, or absolutely obsessed with formality and has by human standards a very perverse sense of accountability-- the kind of logic that says a match can be guilty of arson.

So the essence of my question is, how do Christians negotiate this issue? I'm going to assume most do believe in free will, at which point I ask how you justify that belief rationally. If you're a Christian and you do not believe in free will, how do you negotiate the troubling position this puts God in as being directly and knowingly responsible for all of man's depravity?

If you're anybody at all and have relevant, credible, information about the scientific topics that I've invoked, I would be delighted to be corrected or learn more about something.

230149,"Seriously. It's getting annoying how many people jump on the defensive when another group member says, ""Hey, bud, you're only doing 4k dps. What's up?"" 

My husband, who tanks, was just in a LFG normal SFK and halfway through asked a dps why he was only pulling 4k, which was below him. His tone was not insulting, just a general, ""What's up?"" with an intention of maybe giving him a few pointers. But before he could do that he was promptly kicked from the group. 

Don't automatically assume someone is going to be rude to you. If you're doing a ridiculously low amount of dps, don't be surprised when someone points it out. And it's OKAY to have low dps if you just hit 85 and are still in a bunch of 80 purples and quest greens. It's OKAY to be doing low dps if you genuinely aren't sure what your rotation needs to be or what spec is best for your class. It's OKAY to be doing low dps if your geared as a healer or tank but are taking a break and doing some dps (I do this.) Just be honest about your short comings. People generally want to help you be better.

No, if someone asks you ""What's wrong with your dps, noob?"" THEN you can feel free to get defensive.

I personally think it's much ado about nothing...

I originally got bronchitis from an infection I got from a guy at work who picked it up from his kids who got if from elementary school. didn't vap for 4-5 days, then started heavily(for about 2 weeks) once I thought it was gone.

now I'm most definitely sick all over again and am coughing up brown with streaks of red phlegm. I also do cycle class and weight lifting which is very intensive cardio and pushes your lungs very hard.(not in last couple days obviously) so the combination of the dry air plus irritate of the iolite 3 times a day with cycle classes every 2nd day plus just getting over an infection from a week ago.

= extremely sick... I was so tired and completely exhausted for an entire day. I'm still pretty tired and drained and feel awful... I really wanna get high....

Tom and I just became very good friends as I was breaking up with my ex this fall. I shared a lot of personal things with him, and we spent a lot of time together just hanging out and talking. I wasn't really attracted to him, even though i was rebounding. Then, maybe two weeks ago, he started being randomly flirtatious while we were out with friends. He took me aside and told me how beautiful he thought I was, and how he talked about me with his guy friends and how generally great he thought I was. I sort of shrugged it off. After that point, though, I began thinking that maybe he liked me-- we get along so great-- and maybe i liked him back. So last night I went out and he happens to live not so far from me so we met up. I was really drunk, and I asked him what he thought about us dating. He looked at me straight in the eye and said that he wasn't attracted to me. I basically blankly stared and got up and left. It was so, so, so embarrassing and I just feel like I've been punched in the face. Why would a guy tell me I was ""beautiful"" totally unsolicited and then tell me he was not interested in me?
I'm not a bad-looking person. I get compliments often and don't have trouble attracting men. I'm petite but have big boobs and have been told I look like mila kunis. (i'm ukranian like her)
He is tall, lanky and very trendy. He's into philosophy, shopping and music. He's better dressed than I am.  He has had maybe two serious girlfriends.
Is he just a manipulative jerk? Or gay? Or am I just hopelessly misreading signals?
Here's the other thing. My friend told me a story that he did a very similar thing to another girl he was friends with-- he spent a lot of time with her after a breakup and then told her he wasn't attracted to her.
Please help me understand, guys of reddit! I am happy to answer questions if you need more info...

He also told me how passionate he thought i was about my goals. I responded by smiling and saying thank you-- it was so unexpected and i didn't know how to react.

231733,"I became allergic to dairy and peanuts when I was 22.

Every holiday since then, my family initially forgets that I can't eat certain things.  I understand, since this is not a life-long affliction.  More than once I've left family gatherings to eat alone at a restaurant because they ordered pizza.

After I remind them that I cannot eat dairy (the peanuts aren't normally an issue), they insist on asking me if I can eat this, that, or the other on just about everything.

Example: five minutes ago my mother asked me if I can eat Thompson's Muffins, expecting me to know the answer off the top of my head.  I said that I didn't know without looking at the ingredients.  She checks them and sees ""whey, buttermilk, etc."" at the end of the ingredient list and an allergy warning that says in bold letters ""*allergens: milk...*""  She then asks me again if I can eat it.

At least once a year I have to give the following speech, which I literally just gave for the 4th year in a row: ""If it says whey, milk, butter, or any other thing related to dairy, I CANNOT EAT IT.  It doesn't matter how much there is.  It doesn't matter if it's just one thing.  I cannot eat cheese.  I cannot drink milk.  I cannot drink bailey's irish cream.  I cannot have anything that has any dairy in it.  I cannot have milk chocolate or chocolate milk.""

This usually happens after two or three days of incessant ""well, can you eat it if..."" questions.  You'd think that after I told them no to the first 10 questions, they would quit asking me if I can eat this thing that I have told them time and again that I simply cannot eat.

EDIT: In response to the ""how did these come about"" comments:  I was working my way through college at a pizza place.  I worked the ovens, and while cooking the pizza didn't matter so much (unless some asshole wanted peanuts, but that's another story for another day), eating it on my break frequently caused stomach pains.  After a while, these stomach pains turned into somewhat painful diarrhea.  I figured, maybe it's time to get this checked out.  Went to an allergist and got the prick test done.  Among my hundred-something ""kind of allergic to it"" responses, I found that dairy and peanuts were among the worst.

Your body chemistry shifts a bit every seven or so years.  Mine shifted into massive amounts of allergies.  In a couple of years, my allergies *may* change.  Even so, I actually feel so much better avoiding dairy (more energy, better sleep, better figure) that if I could start eating it again, I don't think I'd want to.",-1,-1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-1,-1,-1,0,-1,-1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-1,-1,-1,0,-1,-1,0

I told my son I'd gift him a bunch of games for Christmas and sure enough it was a winning present idea. I managed to purchase him a few titles using my credit card without any problem but then I start getting card declined messages.
I check my bank online and it says it's fine so I wait and try again later, same thing. I call my banks CC hotline and get them to check I haven't been blocked for suss spending or anything and they say all is fine. I try another purchase through steam and it's again declined but the CC people tell me that it was never processed or rejected by them.

So I try PayPal... but I get another purchase declined error.... this sucks.

I go elsewhere online and make a small cc purchase just to check my cc is still working, no problem.

I've now messaged steam support but I don't know how long a reply will take. Its Christmas and I want to get my son the games he wants now.

I try again with steam and this time try adding funds to my steam wallet with my cc. That works.
Thinking my payment troubles are now over I start rejoicing but then when I try to purchase with my wallet funds I get a lovely error ""The payment processor has reported an authorization failure. Please select a different payment method.""

So now I have 25 bucks in my steam wallet I don't want and I still can't buy my son his Christmas presents. Christmas is just about over here (Australia) so he has to miss out for today. Still he has plenty of games to keep him busy for now.

During visits people should tell the officers what plans they have for the day so that if they stray from their plan the officers will know something is up. Wouldn't it be for the better?

We should do whatever we can to stop privacy. We know privacy is the biggest contributing factor to things such as teenage pregnancies, divorces, criminal and subversive activities in general.

I think the TSA is a big step in the right direction. I would like to issue a thanks to Homeland security for their immense contribution to our safety. Security shouldn't be optional and privacy is a small price to pay for security. I hope one day we can everyone feel extremely safe and be extroverts.

There's already a cultural reform going on in America spearheaded by our magnanimous government that's about combating privacy and by extension terrorism.

234491,"Hey /r/Libertarian,

I've been a mild Libertarian for a while now, and I've described my position to others like this:

* *Democrats*: Into controlling your money, less interested in controlling your personal life.
* *Republicans*: Into controlling your personal life, less interested in controlling your money.
* *Better*: Take the Democrat's stance on personal life, and the Republican's stance on money, and you're doing much better than before.

Note: These are broad stroke type descriptions, and they usually suffice for a discussion like this.


For what it's worth, according to [politicalcompass](http://www.politicalcompass.org), I'm:

Economic Left/Right: -1.12

Social Libertarian/Authoritarian: -5.59 


I used to be FAR more economically ""hands off"" than I am now.  And I wanted to yak with you folks about it.


Here's are the arguments I've been mulling over for quite some time now, laid out in ""assumptions and conclusions"" format:

* *Assumption 1-A*: Fiscally speaking, Democrats tend to be less Libertarian than conservatives.  (Taxes, regulation, social-program-spending, ...) 
* *Assumption 1-B*: The 16 years we had under Clinton and Bush-2 fit relatively well with Assumption 1.
* *Assumption 1-C*: Our economic situation was significantly better under Clinton than under Bush-2 (Trying to take as sophisticated view on this as I can:  Give time for them to get going, and make them responsible for the starting period of the next president.  Wars are tricky here.)
* *Conclusion 1*: Perhaps a more Libertarian fiscal policy doesn't necessarily result in a better economy.

.


* *Assumption 2-A*: For quite some time now (Since Carter I think) the ""income gap"" tends to be larger under Republican presidents/congresses than when Democrats are in charge.
* *Assumption 2-B*: During that same time period, Republicans have fit better fiscally with a Libertarian's views than Democrats.
* *Assumption 2-C*: Large ""income gaps"" are at the very least, not extremely desirable, and may be harmful if they are too big.  (Think access to justice, policy influence, ability to buy healthier food [fresh vegetables vs. ramen], ...)
* *Conclusion 2*: Perhaps a more Libertarian fiscal policy doesn't necessarily result in a better quality of life for the general populace.

.


* *Assumption 3-A*: Republicans match the fiscal components of Libertarian ideals better than they match the social components of Libertarian ideals.
* *Assumption 3-B*: Democrats match the social components of Libertarian ideals better than they match the fiscal components of Libertarian ideals.
* *Assumption 3-C*: Most Libertarians, when voting for one of the big two American political parties, end up voting Republican.
* *Conclusion 3*: Most Libertarians care more about fiscal issues then social issues.


.


Obviously, I'm taking a very high view here; as there are clearly specific places where the general trends I've tried to lay out above do not fit the model.  But I think, as a whole, the basic ideas are relatively accurate.

Also, I'm ignoring all sorts of other social goals a society generally desires. (Safety from foreign entities, mild political stability, fairness, equality, ...)


*Note:* I tried to lay this out in an organized fashion to facilitate intelligent discussion.  If you disagree with something, let me know which part.  Is it my assumption that's the issue, or does my conclusion not follow from my assumptions.



EDIT: Formatting (Good god, do I apparently love bullet points.  I've got to figure out a good way to put in a line break.)

EDIT 2: Most of the comments I'm seeing are vaguely in these two catagories:

* *Don't try to compare right vs. left, and don't fit Libertarians into some combination of those two camps.*

I find that tremendously difficult.  It's the only system we've got to examine right now, (at least at a large scale) and the only major changes I can think of, with which to base conclusions on, are policy shifts or (by proxy) major vote swings.

* *The Republicans aren't what you think they are. They're just as bad as the Democrats.*

I don't disagree.  However, I think the rhetoric and, well, bitching is so much stronger against Democrats than it is against Republicans.  There is/was nowhere near the level of contempt for Bush/Cheney in /r/Libertarian as there is for Obama/Pelosi.  And most Libertarians I've met usually vote Republican. (If they aren't ""wasting their vote"" on the Libertarian candidate.  I know it's not wasted, but you definitely know what I'm getting at.)

**TL/DR - Depressive Episode is overpowering logic, feel alone, guilty about the past few years, and I hate the holidays.**

BPII. For over a year I was on Zyprexa, no episodes. Switched to Depakote due to side effects and started cycling again, finding out the Depakote didn't work for me (but still experienced the utterly crushing side effects.) Switched to Lamictal to control the cycles and have had no issues in  the past six months.

I guess it's time to up my dosage.

I noticed I was down last night. I sent a mass ""Merry Christmas"" text to around 30 people I am very close to yesterday afternoon. I never received any responses. Logically, I knew it was the holidays, and there would be network congestion. Then I noticed I was receiving messages from some of them about other things (mostly my employees who were included, asking work questions.) It was a massive blow. Family, best friends, women I have been or am currently romantically linked to giving me no response at all. Even my mother, who was estranged for twelve years and has been my rock since being diagnosed hasn't gotten back to me.

I have had an on again / off again fuck buddy for over a year (since around the time I was diagnosed, and just after my engagement fell apart.) It's a strange relationship - discrete, but we're openly good friends. We can talk all night about anything, have incredibly passionate sex, and kiss in a way that I've only ever experience with long term girlfriends. She was there when I hit rock bottom and is the closest I will probably come to falling in love for a long time. We've talked about our feelings, but due to external reasons it became apparent that we could not have a relationship. We have sex with other people, and it doesn't bother me. Last night I found out she's most likely seeing her ex-boyfriend again. We have plans next week. Not knowing if it's emotional (with either her ex or myself) or strictly physical is killing me today.

As I said in another thread, the holidays have never been about friends and family. Everyone disappears back home, I'm 2,000 miles from the rest of my relatives, and times like Christmas and Thanksgiving become studies in isolation. I suppose that's why I volunteer to work every holiday - I don't want to spend that much time alone and unoccupied.

My only nearby relative is my father, who loves me, but is distant and completely unsure about how to handle my emotional issues.

I'm a writer. Working on my second novel, and I've written seven different graphic novels since I was 20. One of my closest friends is an artist who is now beginning to become in demand among publishers throughout the mainstream comics world. We often talk about working with each other, and at this point I really only write comics for him. He recently asked me to write a short story for a recently launched online comics page. I jumped at the chance and found myself deeply entrenched in the world (illustrating 600 years of human history, future physics, cosmological models.) Last night I finished it and sent it off to him. He asked me to hop on Skype to talk. Unfortunately he won't be able to work on it any time soon, as he has been offered a high profile project that might lead to him finally being able to support himself and his wife with his art.

I don't blame him. I completely support him. I'm his friend, and his biggest fan. I encouraged him to follow through with this, but I'm crushed that again I won't be able to work with him for at least another year.

I'm twenty six, and I've thrown away three life changing opportunities in the last six years. The guilt is crushing. Nothing is comforting me. Again, I find myself hating the world, hating myself, and wishing I had someone behind me right now.

I know my friends and family, this girl who was there when it was the worst, my employees who are as close to me as people I've known for years, my friend and his wife who have talked me through and comforted me during crippling depression despite living on the other side of the continent - I know they all love me. I know that there's a lot going on right now and all of this shit is just coincidence.

I just can't get away from being hurt. I can't tell anyone, I don't want to worry them or appear needy. I can't ruin the holidays for all of these people I love. I just feel trapped.

**UPDATE** - Took a second dose, desperately. Was able to even out within a few hours. My employees, who are absolutely wonderful, kept me entertained throughout the day - even though they thought I was simply hung over.

I really appreciate the kind words, everyone. You guys were wonderful. Even though I still haven't heard from anyone all day (most shockingly my Mom,) I was able to push through and stabilize.

I randomly decided to go check if Mac Donald is still open and then to go do a head count at the shelter. I pitched up at the shelter greeted the guys and two of them quickly helped me count 20 heads. 

I then drove back to Mac Donald and got a giggle to hear the guy at the order counter ask me to confirm the 20 burgers and drinks order.

I stacked the food on the passenger seat and drove back to the shelter where I dropped it of and then I drove away after a couple of guys said thank you and Merry Christmas.

I feel guilty because I didn't stay to check that the food was divided equally but at least I did something tonight.

Only Reddit and my Girlfriend will ever know about this event, because she messaged me while I was busy buying the food to check if I'm fine and this is a throw away account so I will stay anonymous.

I only wish for one thing that I can find a better way to help people... that really wants help, without me giving money to thieving charity organisations in my local area, Poverty is high around here and what I did tonight was more a selfish deed to make me less empty.

Thanks for reading and Merry Christmas.

A while ago a teacher of mine told me about this musician called ""[Toshimaru Nakamura](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toshimaru_Nakamura)"" who uses a mixing board to create ""no input"" music, which is done by taking the output and inputting it back into the mixer, which creates a feedback loop that you then manipulate with the EQ knobs and faders. 

This is interesting to me and I was curious if anyone here did things like this? How do you go about doing it without blowing speakers (do you just have the gain down at first or what?) and is it hazardous to the mixer to do this? What are some decent mixers for cheap?

237163,"So my second Xbox 360 crapped out on me this month, just a few months past the warranty of course. Upset with the continued failure of their products I call them up and ask for a free repair. 

I give them my story (all true by the way) about how I waited in line for the original Xbox console, and paid $200 when it broke and I had to send it away, I bought a second Xbox 360 immediately after my first one failed. I've had the same Xbox Live account since it launched (good old Mechassault) and I've spent hundreds on DLC. Along with that I've bought 6 controllers (they've broken down over time), numerous headsets, play and charge kits, dozens of games (many of which I've waited in line for), wireless adapter, and even stupid faceplates. All in all I've spent well over 6 thousand on Xbox products, maybe more. I've been a loyal customer since day one. So when I call and tell them that the second Xbox had broken I was insulted when they said I'd have to pay full price for a repair. It brought up the Logitech thread in my head where a redditor said 'companies invest in us, so we continue to invest in them.' 

After tons of time on the phone, escalations, and cancelling my Live account the most they offered me was $99 for the repair(down from $119, whoopie). Something I found outrageous as I could walk to Best Buy this second and buy a brand new console with a controller for $129. I told them that I was done with Microsoft products (which I am) and called it, telling them that they were losing out on any future games and accessories I would have bought, along with the next console whenever it comes out and all the costs associated with it. It seems utterly insane for a company to refuse a customer like me favor like a free repair, the guy who helped me cancel Live agreed completely. Oh well I suppose, fuck Microsoft and fuck the shitty Xbox. I enjoyed my time with it a lot and I'm sad it had to end this way.

Basically am I just being stubborn by refusing to pay them another $100 for a piece of shit that will probably break on me? Or is their customer service actually that incredibly shitty?

EDIT: Oh, and another thing that happened while on the phone. The guy said that there was an extended warranty offer of 3 years for consoles killed by the E74 error which was what broke my first one. After he ran that serial number he told me I had only missed that by several months as well. My fault for not calling when it broke, but at the time the RROD were all the rage and the only thing I was aware that was worthy of extra warranty. I had no idea about the E74 coverage and I'm positive I never received an email on the subject. As I said its my fault for not calling but that was just extra fuel for my rage fire.

EDIT2: Thank you everyone for the incredible amount of helpful advice! I knew this would be a good place to come! I've emailed Consumerist and I've begun shopping around for desktops and PS3s, planning on selling all my 360 games which should give me more than enough to purchase a system of my choice and a couple games!

237230,"So I was thinking last night, some, if not a lot, of the people partial to the religious sentiment believe Atheists/non-believers to be void of control. With no God/s to strike fear in to our hearts we are feasting on all forms of immorality we can find. Because as they see it, with nothing to fear, why would you try to behave decently?  It scares me that a large population of our world thinks like that. 

Personally I don’t need these deities to tell me if I’m doing something wrong.  You know, instinctually as a human, you know if what you are doing is right or wrong. And if I do something wrong, I pay for it heavily with mental beatings from my conscious, I feel ashamed and I dislike that feeling so I try to avoid it. I understand not all people have this response however.  

But I’m getting off the point. If these people believe they would be totally out of control without religion...and say we could press a button and take these deities away from them, would it really be in our/the world’s best interests? I know it’s mostly the fundies that think that way, but they’re the ones that scare me the most. Just wondering what you guys think really.

**TL:DR If religious people believe we are free to be immoral without  God/s, would we want them not to have a God?**

I'm a little confused on a situation and would like some insight if anyone has any, so here's the background.  I'll try and keep this as short as possible. 

I was dating this guy for a couple of months, and then we ended things because our life paths were sort of incompatible.  So that was in early November, and I figured we would pretty much never talk again.  Since then, we've emailed and texted a bit, sometimes I initiate and sometimes he does.  I assumed that this was because even though we were no longer seeing each other, neither of us is the type of person who runs out and finds someone else immediately, so the attention is sort of nice and to be honest, on my end, ending things was not exactly what I wanted.  However, I'm okay with it, even though I think it's stupid.  

So I figured you know, whenever someone started seeing someone else (I assumed it would be him and I assumed I would feel bad when this happened, but I would deal with it then) we would stop talking.  Then he started calling me.  He doesn't call a lot (maybe once a week) and we talked once for a while, but I was nervous and after that, I thought, ""this is it, we're never talking again,"" and then he called the next week and the week after that.  I have since avoided being on the phone with him for any excessive length of time.  

I don't know what's happening.  Are we being friends?  I don't really need more friends.  But what if it's something more?  I know I should ask, but we're supposed to hang out (what?!) in a couple of weeks and part of me wants to see how it plays out and part of me is so nervous because even just being on the phone made me nervous.  I just don't know how to act.  I'm so not all breezy and cool in these situations.  Do you guys have any ideas? What is he thinking?  Could my dreams come true and he'll confess that he made a mistake?  

I'd just like to say that though I sound like a basket case to you guys, I don't think I come off that way to him.

So I had a small plan with my friends, we (me and 3 of my closer friends) were heading to New Jersey for 3 days after Xmas so we could take a trip into NY and get some Shake Shack and go to places like Central Park and Times Square. You know, just a fun little get away type thing. 

As a Christmas gift, my family footed the bill for a hotel room at a HoJo in New Brunswick. I was planning on getting there early due to an impending storm coming. We needed to get there early on the 26th. We're right near Boston, so to get there around noon on Sunday we'd need to leave MA by 8 or 9 AM. 

So, since the snow is on the way my father (who is lending me our 4WD mini-van for the trip) backed out of the offer today because he thinks it's not safe. 

Before today, he had given me his word that if we got out on the road early enough and did it properly, he would trust me to get there safely without any trouble. Him and my mother both have forbidden me to go, and now I need to help my Dad shovel snow at the Belmont Bank chains that we work at (we're a cleaning company that has a contract for snow removal at the entire 8 bank chain). 

So instead of having tons of fun with my friends (whom are just this week coming home from college in other states/areas) I am now going to shovel large amounts of snow for little pay. Also, the hotel does not offer refunds and it's in Jersey so God knows we're not getting any of the 130 dollars back. 

I'm very pissed, but on the other hand I really can't complain. I still live my life very comfortably and don't want to sound like an ungrateful ass on Christmas while I have a nice warm house and food on my plate every night. I just wanted to ask one simple question of you Reddit, one little thing.

Do I go with Gran Marnier straight, or some nice Bacardi and Coke to numb the disappointment?

239984,"I'm the parent of 18 and 14 year old boys.  For the past few weeks I've read story after story of teens and young adults admitting their atheism to their parents and the parents reacting with horror, ridicule and scorn.  I just want to send some fatherly love out to my fellow redditors who may not be feeling any at the moment.  

I am an atheist and believe it is up to my boys to decide what it is they believe.  If they become Baptist preachers, I'll love them just as much as if they become the Richard Dawkins of the next generation.  Any parent that would disown or shun their child over religious beliefs isn't much of a christian in my book.  

My 18 year old is a self-described deist who thinks there may be some sort of prime mover, but doesn't believe in rewards or punishment in the afterlife.  My 14 year old doesn't talk about religion, but has gone to church with his mom and would probably say he believed in god if someone asked him.  I leave it up to him to talk to me about it if he wants to.  

I recently admitted my atheism at work to a couple of evangelical co-workers and one of them thanked me for making him think (he was asking what my morals were based on and after explaining, I asked him if I could prove that god didn't exist, would he go out and start raping and killing others).   I'm hoping it doesn't affect my career (I live in the South where atheism is about the same level as a bearded lady).

240410,"I saw a lot of great threads these last few days. I saw people just giving away games for no real reason. I, of course, tried to get some, because who honestly doesn't like free stuff? 

A few hours ago, I found an old unused access key for Guild Wars. I was going to try to sell it, maybe get some cash to get some more games before the sale ends. But then I remembered all the other people who were gifting games to random people. 

Now, I don't celebrate Christmas (or any holiday, for that matter) so today isn't different from any other day. I don't worry about getting gifts or giving them. I'm not selfish, though. I just don't really have anyone to do these things with. I was raised to believe that anyone who wasn't from the same religion was evil and would ""cause me to stray from the path."" For the last 15 years, I've spent my time ignoring people and being alone, especially during holidays. 

Why am I rambling? I don't know. Anyway, for some reason I decided to give the code I found to someone. So I posted it here, and got a few replies almost immediately. As I gave it to the person who responded first, I looked at the other people who had replied, hoping they would be lucky enough to get something. I felt bad, perhaps because I'm not used to causing disappointment for anyone other than my parents. It hurt me to have to choose who would get it. But fair is fair, and the person who asked first got it. 

I was about to close the page and go back to browsing when an idea struck. I had a bit of money I was saving for some games that may pop up as daily deals. After the last few days of sales, I realized that I didn't really need to buy a game just because it's on sale. I have a lot of games already. I should use a bit of it to give someone else a game. So I did. I looked through the names of the others who had replied, added them to a list, and edited my post to let them know that I would give away another game. They simply had to reply with a game choice within a certain time frame and I would choose one to get the game. Seeing as I'm unemployed, I put the limit at $5. 

I waited a while before I got 3 responses: two from people who missed their chance on the access code, and another from a random person who saw the post afterwards. I hate to admit it, but I had almost been hoping that nobody would reply. Why? I didn't want to have to choose between them. What's wrong with me? Why couldn't I do this, when so many others can? I waited to see if any others would respond. If there were more, I could just number them and use a random number generator to pick for me. That would make it so much easier, I told myself. 

I waited for what seemed like hours (it was maybe 10 minutes) before I finally decided I would have to choose. I looked at the three people I had to choose from. Three. Not ten, not 50. THREE. 

Then I looked at my bank account again.

""well, one of them is asking for a game that costs less than a dollar. and it's only $5 for each of the others. I can do this.""

And I did. I gave each of them a game of their choice, and 2 to the person asking for the cheapest game. Why? I don't know. Maybe I felt bad for giving something so cheap. Maybe I thought they deserved more for putting up with my indecisiveness. 

Maybe, deep down, I'm just nice. 

Crazy, I know, but it was just a thought. I felt relieved to be done with it, and I felt pretty good. I still couldn't imagine how all these other people could do this so much. Every few minutes there was another kind-hearted person giving stuff away. I went back to reloading the new submissions page like the addict I am.

Then, an orange envelope.

Messages from the people who received their games, thanking me. A smile stuck itself on my face. There was the good feeling others must feel, this warmth. With a small gesture of kindness, I had made someone else happy. After the depressing few days I've had, suddenly I feel like I did something that mattered. I felt good. 

A while later, I received another message from the person who received two games. It said:

""I would like to take a moment to properly thank you for your kindness. I extend my sincere gratitude to you, for this gift has put me past the tipping point in terms of how I lead my life. Lately a number of things have changed, with this being the most recent. This year has been an interesting one, albeit long and stressful. I became stressed, cynical, and frustrated largely with my environment, and didn't deal with the right things. These past few months I begrudgingly began to change, and these past few months have been the most beneficial and rewarding out of the entire year. I see my self as a better person now, and your kindness has influenced my view of the world and community. I hope you and your close ones have a very happy holidays, and I wish you all a very happy and safe new year. Thank you very much =]""

2 games. Two cheap little games that I gave to them on a whim. That's all I did. I had no idea how to reply. I just said something short (and dumb) and went back to what I was doing. But, obviously, it stayed in my mind. And that's why I'm here. I just wrote this thing for I don't know how long, i'm a terrible writer, and I bet nobody will see it anyway. But I don't care. I'm proud of what I did. I may be broke now, but I made other people happy. And that's that.

I then read about the link between omega 3 and depression. So I started taking about three 1000mg fish oil capsules a day. Over time it helped, but was still up and down a bit.

Then I read another weight loss book that suggested at least ten 1000mg fish oil capsules a day. That sounds like a lot, but its not actually a drug, just a form of food really and not expensive. 

So I started taking around fifteen 1000mg tablets every day. I figured it can't hurt and three capsules helped, maybe more will help more. I have found its pretty much cured depression after a month or two. I don't know for sure that the fish oil and end of depression are directly linked. Maybe it was something else that I have not realised that caused the change, but I'm pretty confident the link is there for me.

None of this is with the help of doctors or therapists. I have self diagnosed and never sought out help from a professional. But I have read alot and run through self diagnostic questionnares so I'm pretty confident that my assessment of my mental state is roughly correct.

I tough I was being clever when I asked my parents to get me a ""trimmer"" for Christmas, instead what I got was plastic garbage, it came in this kit called ""Conair trimming kit"" I was exited, took me 3 hours to re-read the instructions until they made sense, and wasn't worth it, it's not working, the main piece in the trimmer kit was a clipper, I'm def not impressed by it, but I did some research online and from the looks of it, most people use professional grade clippers, I went on amazon and quickly did a search for ""trimmer"" and placed ""search by ratings"" 
this is what it gave me: http://www.amazon.com/Wahl-8655-Peanut-Shaped-Clipper/dp/B000M1IX92/ref=sr_1_5?s=hpc&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1293355712&amp;sr=1-5

241614,"I asked [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/eqnoo/how_should_i_cook_a_duckling/) how I should cook a duck and looked at a few other place online. I'm afraid I forgot to take any pictures (I was running about an hour late and hadn't had any breakfast by the time it was all done!), but trust me - it looked as good as it tasted, and it tasted pretty damn good! Choice comment from a guest: ""I wasn't sure I liked duck, but now I definitely do!""

**This is bascially what I did:**  
I trimmed the duck of excess fat inside, and the skin from the tail, then rinsed it under running water. I pierced the skin several times all over with a sharp knife, the put it on a rack upside down, before puring a small amount of boiling water over it into the pan (this apparently loosens the fat, I'm not sure I would bother doing this step again though). I then stuck it in a pre-heated oven at about 220C for half an hour. After that half hour I took it out, drained the fat from the pan so I could do the roast potatoes in it, and put it back in the right way up, realised I had forgotten to season it and sprinkled it with a little salt, before turning the heat down to about 180C and left it for about another hour. I then took it out to make room to do the side dishes (I need a bigger, and ideally fan assisted, oven!). Once they were done I put the duck back in and turned the temerature back up to finish crisping up the skin. 

While that was cooking for the first half hour I chopped the gibblets and the trimmed fat and skin, and stuck them and the blood from the gibblets bag in a pan on the stove, while I boiled a kettle. I had intended to brown the gibblets but there was too much liquid, so I didn't bother and just added some boiling water, a couple of bay leaves and cloves, and a lid and left it to simmer for a good long time. Later, while peeling the potatoes I added the skins too. After about an hour and a half I drained the liquid from the bits, chucked them away and oput the liquid back on the stove. I added a generous teaspoon full of honey and a good spalsh of red wine, put the lid back on and left it to simmer. After a while I thought ""I had better thicken this gravy now"", and took a look at it, only to realise the water had all cooked away and I had made duck, honey and wine flavoured toffee sauce! I thinned it down a little and it made the most amazing sweet-savoury sauce for the duck! Pure accident massively improved the meal!

I served it with roast potatoes cooked in the duck fat, with a little salt, pepper and paprika, some stuffing made frm a cheap packet of sage and onion stuffing mix made up with orange juice instead of water, and some pork sausage meat that had cranberries and apple in it which I had got cheap, pressed into a pan and topped with pepper and breadcrumbs. I then realised I had forgotten to cook the carrots and hurridly did some peas! I completely forgot to do devils on horseback (sausages wrapped in bacon) and will have them today instead. 

All in all it was good. Very good. And I will be cooking duck again in the future! Thanks to everyone who gave me advice.

241720,"Hi r/Buddhism. This is something I was just thinking about while taking a shower (when all the best thinking happens, duh). It's not super profound or anything, but I felt the urge to type it out here.

I see a whole lot of conversation in this subreddit about whether or not Buddhism is a religion. Is it? Is it not? Is it a way of life? Is it a philosophy with a meditative component? There's nothing wrong with this conversation. I don't think it's going to stop any time soon, and I'm not trying to squash it or anything.

However, I've been taught, and tend to believe, that part of Right View is no fixed view. The minute we label something, especially something like The Great Way, we make a mistake. Don't get me wrong, in our relative reality, it's a constantly necessary mistake of convenience to refer to transitory things in there present state. But in that light, it might be especially helpful in this case to relax our views of what Buddhism is or is not and just practice.

Buddhism is whatever it needs to be for any given practitioner.  And just like the chair you're sitting on can only be called a chair because it's comprised entirely of non-chair elements, Buddhism can only be called Buddhism because it is inherently empty of any fixed identity. To way oversimplify something as huge as a ""major world religion*"" it is both Buddhism, not Buddhism, both, and neither.  Apply the same formula to the (already slippery) words ""religion"" and ""philosophy"".

So that's my muddled take on it this morning. I hope you all had a good December 25th, whatever that day means to you!  Deep bows to all of you.

[Here are some pictures](http://imgur.com/a/stk48) of a couple of Memory Pillows that I've made.  I got the idea when my bunny died back in 2003 and I cut off some of his fur before burying him and put it inside a pillow I made with his name on it.  I've perfected the design since then and added a picture frame.

I think it's a really great alternative to a wooden or metal urn.  It's cheaper and I can still fully customize with color, embroidery, picture frame, and pouch.

My mom thought it was morbid at first, but I made her one without the pouch and she just has a nice pillow with my dog's name and picture on it which she keeps on the chair where she used to sleep.

It's not just for animals either, really.. A friend of mine had me make her one for her niece when her father passed away to keep his watch inside.

I'm trying really hard to not make this sound like an ad.  It truly isn't, but I've been urged in other posts to at least show Reddit what I've made.

241967,"So:  Six months ago I was dumped by my girl of 5 years (started dating at 19, lived together past 3).  I'm still a mess about it, and I want some closure.  I spent a significant amount of that time fixing her.  She had serious emotional problems and my constant support transformed her from a really broken kid into a effective human being.  I even got her into grad school through recommendations and introductions (on top of emotional support).

I never implied that my support was a charity (in fact, when she felt unworthy of my ""generosity"", I justified it by saying when the tables were turned, she'd support me, and she agreed).

Jump to last year.  She finally has less stress / less crazy than me.  I'm working like crazy and she's finished with grad school apps and has a year to enjoy herself.  Which she does.  Without me.  I don't have the energy to confront her because I'm completely swamped.  Housework?  I do that.  What does she do?  Lots of empty promises.  Excuse:  ""I'm going to grad school, this is my last chance to have fun.""

At the end of the year she dumps me.  And I'm sick of her because she's been so absent.  But really, I just want her to shape up, not leave.

I just feel that she owes me.  She owes me for what I've put in.  She owes me for where she is in life.  And she tells me that I should have left her instead of giving.  Well I certainly would have if I had realized that it was a one way street.

I have a hard time giving up on this girl who I've putten so much into.  But I know I'm wasting my time if I want to get back with her and I feel like I'm wasting my time with regards to simply getting her to admit to herself that she's wrong.  But without that, I end up feeling so much more used / abandoned / worthless.

Am I deluding myself into thinking that some closure will make anything any better?  Or should I cut my losses, deal with the depression and try to move on without it.

242534,"When I was about 14-15 (33 now), my high school math teacher was behind on grading my class' mid-term exams one day, so we got to partake in the much-beloved 'video day'. He said he was going to put in an educational tape on math relationships, but the tape that he ended up starting up was clearly not what he planned on showing us.

The program started with a businessman standing on a median in the middle of a busy road looking confused. He shakes it off, goes to work, does his normal routine, but some amount of time later, he 'awakes' and finds himself standing on the median, dressed for work, with cars rushing past him as he struggles to come to his senses.

Now, it was obvious that my teacher hadn't seen either the tape he WANTED to show us or the tape that ended up playing. The whole class kept waiting and waiting to see what 'math relationships' had ANYTHING to do with what we were watching and eventually my teacher's attention wandered from grading his papers at his desk to watching the video with us, trying to figure out what in the hell he had put in the VCR.

Anyway, the businessman's psyche breaks down further and further as he realizes that he's stuck in some kind of time loop. Basically goes crazy. So somehow (I think this is how it goes) he figures out how to slightly manipulate events in his loop to the extent that he can manipulate objects. I'M NOT POSITIVE THIS IS EXACTLY HOW IT ENDS, since I only saw it that one time nearly 20 years ago, but the last time he 'wakes up' on that median, he opens his briefcase, takes out a big-ass silver-plated revolver...and blows his brains out. It was fairly graphic, too. A split second of flying blood and brains, if I recall correctly. The screen went black for like 10 seconds...and the guy woke up on the median again. Roll credits.

Anyhow, the class went apeshit, hooting and hollering, clapping, etc. My teacher was seriously pissed and muttered the requisite 'obviously this isn't the tape I intended to show you', but it was an epic moment in my H.S. years and I've never been able to figure out what it was we watched. Was it one of the 1980's Twilight Zone episodes? Was it an Outer Limits or one of the Amazing Stories? I haven't been able to find a synopsis that fits the video that I watched in any of those shows. I have no idea what it was but I'd love to see it again.

--------------------
tl;dr - About 20 years ago, my high school math teacher accidentally showed my class a fucked-up video with some businessman stuck in a time loop. The show ended with him blowing his brains out...and ends up 'waking up' again, still stuck in the time loop. Have no idea what show it was, even though I've looked for it from time to time, but I wanna know if Reddit can help solve the puzzle.

Thanks in advance, Reddit peeps. :)

242572,"To avoid spending money on books I'll read just once, and to save shelf space, I borrow most of the books I read from the local library (which belongs to an excellent regional library-sharing program which lets me request any book online and have it sent to my home library from any other library for free - like Netflix for books).

I read about 40-50 books a year, and easily 95% of them come from the public library.

I received a Kindle 3G for Christmas from my family, who knows how much I love to read (although not necessarily about how I read mostly library books).

I'm debating returning the Kindle, although I'm also curious if I'll never get a chance to find out if I like it without actually trying it out (thus voiding any chance at a full refund).

As a big library reader, is there still use I can get out of the Kindle? Are the prices on books for the Kindle from Amazon good enough to perhaps turn me back into a book-buyer rather than a book-borrower?

242632,"To avoid spending money on books I'll read just once, and to save shelf space, I borrow most of the books I read from the local library (which belongs to an excellent regional library-sharing program which lets me request any book online and have it sent to my home library from any other library for free - like Netflix for books).

I read about 40-50 books a year, and easily 95% of them come from the public library.

I received a Kindle 3G for Christmas from my family, who knows how much I love to read (although not necessarily about how I read mostly library books).

I'm a little worried that I might not get a lot of good use out of the Kindle since I avoid buying most books, and I'd hate to waste someone else's money on a gift I won't use. I'm debating returning the Kindle, although I'm also curious if I'll never get a chance to find out if I like it without actually trying it out (thus voiding any chance at a full refund).

As a big library reader, is there still use I can get out of the Kindle? Are the prices on books for the Kindle from Amazon good enough to perhaps turn me back into a book-buyer rather than a book-borrower?

Or does owning a Kindle not make a ton of sense for a library reader?

About a month or two ago, my best guy friend and I happened to hook up one night. We’ve known each other since high school (we’re both 23) and have been really good friends almost this whole time. To make things even more complicated, he just broke up with his girlfriend of over 2 years a couple of months ago. This was his first serious relationship and they even lived together. I also happened to mention that same night, that I’ve always like him. This was the first time I’ve ever really mentioned it. 

Since this all happened, we haven’t really spoken about it because we live 2 hours away and haven’t really seen each other. Every time we try to hangout, something happens and prevents us from seeing each other.
 
I know he isn’t over his ex, and I would never want to force a relationship onto him or anything like that. Since that night, all the feelings I’ve had for him and have pushed away over the years are now all I can think about. I have no idea if he has those same feelings. I feel like we’re both avoiding each other and what happened and really haven’t talked about it. I have no idea if he has any kind of feelings towards me, or if this was just him being lonely.  With being 2 hours away I can’t just show up at his place to try and talk to him. I know he needs space and time to get over his ex, but a part of me is worried that he’ll move onto someone else that’s not me.

243249,"This happened when I was 11 years old (I'm 20 now), after the death of a very close family friend who drowned after a scuba equipment malfunction.

I had a very hard time dealing with it, mostly because I had an extremely difficult trying to justify what reason any God could have for doing this to our friend. I had contemplated motives of God in the past regarding situations such as poverty in certain areas of the world, but **this specific situation affected me in a most profound way.** The answers I was getting from my parents (both Hindu) and many family friends (mostly Christian/Catholic) only fueled my frustration, as they provided no logical reasoning I could deem satisfactory.

**Then it hit me.** When I took God out of the equation and just broke down the series of events that lead to our friends death, I was able to perceive the situation for what it actually was instead of having so many unanswered questions.

I can safely say this method of **logical reduction** and reasoning is what eased the pain in not just dealing with the death of our family friend, but also in the deaths of others close to me including my older sister when I was 19.

Getting back to me telling my Hindu parents that I'm an Atheist (sorry for wandering off a bit, but I think it is relevant to this)... They had noticed I was having a very hard time dealing with the situation and finding answers as to why it happened, but when I finally took the godless route of logical reduction, they had noticed I was able to deal with the situation much easier than I had before.

So after having a little spiritual smalltalk talk with them about how I had dealt with it, **I just came out and said ""I cannot believe there is a God who would have any good reason to do this to Pete, and if there is I refuse to worship such a being. ""I don't believe in God.""**

Immediately my Dad smiled and said **""son, you may refuse to worship a God or refuse to believe in a God, and in response to that your mother and I refuse to impose our beliefs on you. You must understand that your status as our son has and always will have priority over our religious beliefs no matter what.""**

I was just in awe. I couldn't believe my parents, who are **very** devout Hindus were so open with my decision. After that, they had no problem with me not going to the temple to pray with them (sometimes I went anyways out of respect) and no problem with my not participating in any of their religious activities. They were very open to our religious friends and family about me being an Atheist, and defended my choice vehemently.

I cannot generalize and say all Hindus are this tolerant, but from my personal experience with my parents and literally every other Hindu (and Buddhist) I've met, I have had **zero** issues with them in terms of respecting each others beliefs. No backhanded comments, no condescension-- nothing but genuine mutual respect.

I never knew she had this social anxiety about travel. I wanted her to spend new years at my house, stay the night, and just ring in the new years with me and her.

I do not know what to do on the matter though. I never knew about this. I am still in awe that someone in this day and age could be so afraid about traveling somewhere she has never been before, even though I gave her the directions and said she can call and I would guide her.

I told her eventually she would have to get over this because it's silly. I know how she feels to a degree, I had social anxiety when I was younger. It was so bad I hid behind trees because I did not want to deal with people or new locations. It was silly and I knew I had a problem and I got over it.

She knows she has an issue, she wants to get over it. But I am not going to hold her hand on this, am I in the wrong for that? I would hold her hand but I am not going to.

I did some pros and cons and hopefully you guys can add some. Though 3.33 a month for it (current deal of $50 for 15 months) isn't too bad, those $50 can also mean getting a few games on sale.

Pros
- Free Avatars
- Free Themes
- Free Games
- A chance to try some awesome games that I would have otherwise never played
- Any discounted items purchased are yours to keep
- Anything free that was not a game is yours to keep
- If you didn't have a subscription for some time, but resubscribe at a later date all previous free downloaded games are yours once more

Cons
- Free games are not chosen by you
- Free games are no longer playable if you unsubscribe

So as can be seen, the biggest plus to me seems to be those free games monthly. I mean the one game currently is a whole season of Sam &amp; Max, not too bad, but if I ever unsubscribe then I no longer have access to it. On the other hand I was reading a bit about gamesharing.

Reddit. Today I was attending Christmas celebrations with the extended family, it was a most joyous occasion with Wii balance board games, bountiful food, delicious bacon and unlimited fermented beverages. The conversation was enlightening and intelligent.

Reddit. I tell you this because you have to understand the enormity of what happened next to comprehend the ramifications. Every year we have a raffle where people will throw a die and; if presented with the correct amount of little black spots on the side facing upwards, one will be provided one(1) present to place in front of them. The amount of presents one may amass is without a defined limit.

Reddit. They changed the rules. I'm not sure why one is allowed to change the rules of a tradition but nevertheless it was done, this was my first taste on the bad side of democracy. The new rules were as follows: The presents were to be spread evenly this year, though we were 3 presents short. Each person would throw a die and pass one of their presents counter clockwise to the person whose distance-in-people from you was equal to the amount of little black spots on the side facing upwards.

Reddit. I had 4 presents when the clock chimed it's signal that the games was now over. 4 presents.

Reddit. They changed the rules. There was an additional round. This time the die would pass around to all the people without presents, allowing them a die throw. Upon hitting one of two magic amounts of little black spots they would be allowed to demand a tribute of one (1) present from any person at the table in possession of a gift. People with gifts were now allowed a die throw.

Reddit. I had 4 presents. 4 presents. By the end of the second round I had 0 presents. 0 presents.

Reddit. I implore you to understand the significance of this horrendous acts of Godlessness. If these liberals will heartlessly steal the presents of a hard working family member what will they then stop at? Our money? Our clothes? The teeth in our mouth? I dare not even consider the extend of their greed. Immediate action is required to prevent this so-far-isolated case to explode into a global epidemic of Christmas-stealing Grinches.

Reddit. Next election, vote for me as dictator, I promise there will be absolutely no stolen presents or teeth. I am your last hope.

The next time I benched, I made it all the way to the 4th rep of the 5th set, but from there, I've failed on the 4th rep of the 3rd set and then today on the 4th rep of the 2nd set.

When I started doing SL I was able to bench 110 kg for 7, 4 and 3 reps, but I went down to 85 kg and have been increasing 5 kg per bench session.  

As far as diet goes, I eat 1800-2000 calories a day, which is a pretty big calorie deficit, which I've calculated to be about 1000 kcal as I'm losing about 1 kg a week.  

So it seems to me that I have three options to try to get over this hump.  1) Deload by 20% and only go up 2.5 kg each time. 2) Eat more. 3) More time between sets, as I currently am only taking 1 min between sets on lifts where I haven't previously failed at that weight and 1.5 min on sets where I have failed.

I'd really prefer not to eat more, as my primary goal right now is to lose weight.  I'm currently at 109 kg and my goal is 105, maybe a bit less depending on how I feel about it once I get there.

All of this put a huge strain on my relationship with my girlfriend, who is the only one who knows I was depressed, though she had no idea just how bad it was.

I've been working at feeling better and it's paid off, me and the friend buried the hatchet, I've gotten a lot closer with my girlfriend, I'm set to do a lot better in school next semester.

So I finally get my life in order after months, yet I still constantly think of suicide. I don't think I even seriously consider it, but anytime I have a thought or something happens that I don't like, even the slightest thing. I think that I'll just kill myself. Of course thinking like this day after day certainly doesn't help me being depressed.

So today some stuff happened that I didn't like. I spent about 2 hours thinking about suicide, and now here I am back to feeling just as bad as when I was in the worst of being depressed.


I'm sure my girlfriend would give me support if I talked with her, but I don't want her to worry, nor put any more stress on our relationship.

I used to play some of the more competitive games a few years back (Halo 2, CS, and WoW) when I worked at a LAN center, and I always loved the feel of tournaments and such.  I was never close to the greatest, but I guess I did well enough to not feel embarrassed for entering the tournament.  For various reasons I kinda fell out of the loop, and have only been playing some casual games here and there when I have the chance. But...

I'm looking to get back into the competitive scene some.  I'd like to go to some bigger tournament or MLG events, but I honestly don't know what games are a big deal right now.  What games are people playing on a higher competitive level (i.e. bigger than just online-only tournaments and 5-person tournaments at a LAN center)?  I'm not too worried about genre, just curious as to what people are playing at the MLG or ""big-time"" level (I realize that some games like CS(S) were never MLG, but it would be stupid to say they weren't ever competitive so I don't see it as lame simply because it isn't MLG).

Also, I'd like to play some of the newer games.  WoW if it's still competitive, but looking to get away from CS and Warcraft III.

  I have a macbook with the basic Intel GMA X3100 graphics card installed that it comes with, and OS X 10.5.8.  
  
  When I bought TF2 a couple of days ago I had hopes of playing it right away, but unfortunately it says my graphics card isn't up to par and doesn't meet the system requirements.  
  
  Recent research on forums tells me this setup is fine, and there are workarounds, but I've been having trouble finding said workarounds.  
  
  So I decided to ask the greatest online community I know.  
  
  Has anyone had the same problem? Are there any free alternatives to getting this highly recommended game to play on my MacBook?  
  
  Thanks for any information you can give.  
  
  TLDR; TF2 not working on macbook, any suggestions?

I've been to Alabama with her to meet her adopted parents, old childhood friends and the like and everywhere we went, everyone just couldn't stop talking about their pets. In Texas, when we go out to dinner with her biological family, without fail, pets are almost the dominating topic (with the family business coming in a relatively distant second).

Every time the subject comes up, everyone has to talk about 'funny' things their pet(s) do or have done, pictures have to be shared, etc. Now, this wouldn't bother me so much if this only occurred every now and then or if it was only for a small amount of time. Unfortunately, pets come up EVERY time, and it dominates most of what is typically at least a 2 hour dinner. So reddit, especially redditors from the South, is this common or just my girlfriend's family and friends? What's the rationale for this?

The neighbors' trash is always full of jugs, tubes, and red-tinged coffee filters.  They and their visitors are often *really* tweaked out, sweating, and twitchy, with open sores.  Buying and selling happens at all hours.  They keep their windows wide open even in the dead of winter, and the house has a strong chemical smell - we get a whiff of it every time the wind blows our way.

Now, I fully support their right to be meth-heads - to manufacture, ingest, buy, sell, transport, whatever.  I don't have the right to use legal means to interfere in consensual activity which isn't affecting me.

BUT, I *do* have the right to protect myself using legal means when the actions of others endanger me.  I believe this is clearly one of those cases.  Clandestine meth labs such as these explode quite frequently (see http://tinyurl.com/2djfvzl).  At one spot, our houses are only two feet apart.  We could be watching TV one second and dead in a fireball the next, because one of their extremely zonked-out visitors knocked over a table or something.

We have spoken to their landlord before about other problems we have had with them (screaming and fistfights outside at all hours) but the landlord doesn't seem very interested or responsive.

UPDATE:  Basically what I'm asking is whether there's any other/better way to neutralize this danger instead of calling the freaking drug cops.

I was friends with this girl, great friends, always was interested in her, but had never tried anything since she was dating someone (who we as friends all hated)  She eventually got dumped by the bastard very harshly, and I was there for her pretty heavily.  Like I said, I had always had feeling for her, and eventually (in what I thought was enough time after her breakup, like... 4 or so months) I said something.  She said she wasn't ready, ok... my bad... I backed off, (not as a friend, but in the ""more than friends"" sense) and then over the summer.... practically had all of the responsibilities of a boyfriend, with none of the acknowledgment.

I went on movie ""outtings"" with her, just her and me, where she'd be leaning on me the entire movie, but no more.  Went on what were essentially double dates with our best friends.  Did all the things normally associated with being a boyfriend, with none of the benefits. Talked every day via txt or phone call. Everything....  

After a certain point I tried again, but got the same ""not ready"" response.  I then backed off.... everything.  Eventually our contact dropped off entirely, she moved to a different city for a job (not far, hour and a half drive) 

Now, a year later, she and I are poking eachother on facebook and I'm sititng here tortured, desperately wanting to talk to her again, but knowing I had cut off contact for a reason...  I'm still single, and to be perfectly, frankly, obvious.... still in love with the girl.  She's everything I've ever wanted in a girl, and I haven't been able to get over her, after trying to go out on a few dates, everything winds up compared to her in my mind and I can't get her out of my head.

What should I do..... my best friend says nut up or shutup and ask her out again, and if she says no this time, bury it entirely.  I'm not sure I want to open up to hurt like that.... but.... I don't know.  I'm posting on a throwaway for some advise, though I'm sure one or 2 of my closest friends will know who this is based off the story.

One thing about her is that she's always been a tad shallow, not bad, but somewhat, and I've grown up a lot in the last year or so since she last saw me.

I refused to take a mini-family one with my ""parents"" because they were never parents to me, but I still wanted to take one with the rest of my family for my great-grandparents. We took the pictures, left, and I didn't think about them again.

Christmas morning I woke up at my Gram's (different from the one the pictures were originally for) and went to the tree to put down her present to find a picture of me with my parents staring back at me. They paid the photographer alot of money to photoshop me from the huge family picture into the one with them. I uncontrollably freaked out (not at anyone, just kinda started freaking out). My gram told me that it was a gift to her from my parents and that my other grandma did it for them.

Well, I went over to her house and confronted her about it. She took my parents side of it and said she didn't mean to hurt me by it, but I don't see how it wouldn't have hurt me. She was there for the pictures and saw me argue with my parents and the photographer to not be in the picture. They never asked me if I was okay with it. Why would I want to be associated with the people who abused me?

What do you guys think?

Edit: Because you guys seem to want the full back-story. Here's a few examples of how my mom abused me and my dad just let it happen. 

Well, for starters, she used to physically abuse me. Like, smash my head against the wall, slap me, punch me, push me. I only remember some of it, my dad (who really wanted me to try to fix things with her) admitted that she used to do it all the time. Then, as I got older, she knew that I would tell someone about it, so she just started mentally/verbally abusing me. She would threaten me. ""If you don't ___ you won't be able to see or talk to (close friend that kept me sane for ___ (amount of time)."" ""You shut your mouth or else ___.""And at least once a day she says something extremely hurtful ""Go to your room and shut up, I don't want to even see you."" ""You're completely selfish, I can't believe you would want some of the money back that I stole from you!"" Except I added that last part in because she would never admit to taking my money. Even though I was constantly busy with school, housework, and martial arts she would call me lazy and tell me that all I'm good for is housework. That that was the reason why she had me. The one year, I wasn't doing too hot in school and she kept telling me over and over that I was going to fail and never tried getting me help (in 6th grade I didn't know how to get help). They never supported me in anything that I did. Ever. No matter what happened, it was always my fault. They would just scream at me constantly. They actually had me believing the way they were treating me was normal. That that's how life was, that that's what everyone went through. That you were supposed to use your kid for anything that you could. The times that she was actually human to me, actually made things worse. I would try to believe that she was getting better, that maybe we could have a functioning family, but in an instant she would go back to screaming at me for something or another. Everyone in my family agrees that she cares about her dogs more than anyone or anything. I'm not even joking. It's just absolutely insane. Nothing I did was ever good enough. Oh? You got your shodan (1st degree black belt)? Not good enough. A 95%GPA with all honors classes? Not good enough. Nothing was ever good enough. She would always find something to criticize. I started trying to spend more and more time elsewhere, with friends or with family. I was afraid/depressed to go home because I knew I would just get yelled at. Whenever I'd try to defend myself when she was yelling at me irrationally, she would just instantly cut me off from going anywhere or doing anything. I had absolutely no privacy. She would go through my things, including my computer. She would just walk in my room whenever she felt like it to scream at me. I had no sanctuary. I ended up being hospitalized because she caused so much stress to me that my body started to just act out. None of my doctors could find anything wrong with me except that I was under alot of stress. I'm sorry this reply was all over the place. It's very hard for me to pinpoint examples because it was every day life for me. It took me over three hours to try to explain it to my guidance counselor.

The Scrabble game ended, and as he left, I tried to kiss him goodbye. He pulled away and said, ""I saw you chewing on a silly band, I don't want to kiss you now."" 

I was taken aback for two reasons: First, because he noticed something apparently repulsive and said nothing about it as it was happening; secondly, because he thinks that chewing on a silly band is grounds to forego affection towards his new girlfriend.

My boyfriend is from Singapore, but he studies here in Australia.  We have been going out for almost 6 months and are quite in love.  He hasn't come out to his family as they are Muslim, and believe that being gay is wrong.  Otherwise they are quite progressive and sound like lovely people.

On Friday I'm flying to Singapore where I will be staying with my bf's family and meeting them for the first time.  I'm a little terrified and want to give a good impression -_-'

I think they strongly suspect he is gay, but are in denial and will never ever talk about it, because as long as it remains unsaid it doesn't have to be confronted.  They can't be too uptight about though, as I am flying in and will be staying in his room, which seems pretty suss to me (although we are putting down a 2nd mattress.)

So I want to know what r/lgbt would recommend in terms of how to act in front of them.  I'm sure some of you have had to interact with your partners family when they don't know about your relationship.

If he ever changes his mind about telling them, I want them to know that I am good for him and for them to like me.  I don't want them to feel like I abused their hospitality or use me as a scapegoat for him being gay, rather than accepting him.

Is there any appropriate way to behave in this situation, or am I stuck with faking being only a friend, and hope for the best in the future.

They also have NetFlix so I explain to them how they can use the Wii to watch movies through NetFlix instead of the snail mail way they've been doing. When I go to set it up, I go to the Shop Channel and it says it needs to update, so I accept, and it goes to the update screen, where the bar at the bottom doesn't move at all for about 30 seconds, then it says ""Error Code:32007"" Unable to perform the Wii system update. I try again, and again, and again... Same sh*t.

I'm no dummy, so I test the internet connection on the Wii and I can go on the ""Internet Channel"" just fine, browse google, youtube etc. with no issues whatsoever. I'm connected to the internet through a Linksys Wireless WRT54GS Router, that is on a DSL connection. I could try connecting through Ethernet but the geniuses who designed this box of crap decided to not include a 10/100 card but instead make you buy an accessory that converts USB to Ethernet (retarded), but I'd rather not spend the money on one just to see if this will work, and since the internet connection works anyways, I don't really see the point in going in that direction.

So I get on my laptop and Google the issue to find a few others who have experienced similar problems. This link is to the most relevant forum post I could find:

http://techforums.nintendo.com/message/12519

I also crawled several forums discussing opening ports on my router, changing the router channels, sacrificing my first-born (just kidding), among other ridiculous solutions that would make sense if the Wii WASN'T CONNECTING TO THE INTERNET, but it is, as I previously stated. I tried all this voodoo anyways and to no avail.

So my assumption is that there is something wrong with Nintendo's update service, or this Wii is broken. Seriously though, this is super frustrating and I really doubt when I call the Nintendo Tech Support guys they'll have anything to suggest that I haven't already tried.

Anyone else out there having similar issues? Any solutions you guys would suggest that won't cost me any money? Any and all suggestions are appreciated.

Hey y'all, I've run into a bit of a problem.  I installed Office 2010 on my desktop and laptop.  Recently I upgraded my desktop with a new MB, video card, processor, and memory.  Evidently when you do this, it trips a check on Windows and makes you re-activate everything (which pisses me off *substantially*).  Luckily re-activating Windows was just a matter of clicking a button, but I'm locked out of Office until I can get back home in a couple of weeks and find my product key.  

I was hoping there was a different way, though.  I've looked through the registry on my laptop but can't find it there (or did find it and didn't recognize it due to encryption).  I've been through one keyfinder (which didn't work) off the net but am hesitant to try others as they're not really recommended, rated, or from a site I recognize, so been avoiding them for the sake of not having my key stolen. 

Anyone know of a way or can recommend a legit key finder for Office 2010?  I found one called Magical Jelly Beans that looked like the real deal but it's $25 and I'm not *that* desperate.

249501,"I've been dumped by my girlfriend of two years today. And it's my fault. Only mine. I just hanged up the phone after she said that she doesn't miss me and she doesn't want to talk to me or meet me. I feel like a worthless shit and only now I understand how much I love her. I miss her already and something is eating me inside as I type these words. And if you bear with me and let me tell you how this happened, maybe you can help me do something about it.

I'm a twenty-five year old guy and my exgf is twenty-two years old. One day, while having a guys' night a friend of mine who has been to the US told me about the strip clubs and how you tip the girl while they dance for you (lap dance, I guess.) There's no strip clubs here so I never had the chance for that. I admit I'm a horny guy and the best thing I could experience something similar would be with the ladies who offer their services via instant-messaging protocols (Skype, MSN, Yahoo etc.) You may say, why not go directly to cam4.com and have some of it for free, but I just wanted to experience the tipping, or ""getting a hooker,"" I don't know. (btw I've never done such a thing.) 

So, this was on my mind -guess a few days after the talk- I was in the office and I knew a website where my exgf visits regularly. A place for questions and answers, much like AskReddit. So, I got a nick (headcrab, -I was playing HL2 at that time) and asked the users of the site whether they knew any ladies who offer their services via IM protocols. And I also demanded that I'd like to have an amateur one, and from my country, if possible. (The only reason for that it would be cheaper.) 

Then I got a few replies, and added the IM addresses to my throwaway MSN account. But I didn't have some money (or I guess I have some but I didn't want to do it right away) so I postponed it. Then, when I received my paycheck for the new month, I decided it was not the best thing to do, while you are in a relationship and gave up and decided to forget about the idea.

And indeed I forgot about it. I was getting used to that Q&amp;A website and started asking and replying game-related questions. My exgf knew very well that I'm an avid gamer and she also knew that I was playing HL2 at that time. We even discussed about the headcrabs in HL1. Anyway, after some time, she somehow found out that headcrab was actually me and that I asked a question about the ladies who offer adult services. (At that point I had already deleted the question from the said website but how could I knew that Google already cached it?!)

As expected, she went berserk, burned all the bridges and took no prisoners. She told me that we were over and would never see me again. I tried my best to explain that I was just curious and that I was not into other women but just wanted to try that feeling. Of course, she didn't believe me.

I was devastated and didn't know what to do. With some pathetic attempt [I turned to Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/em55g/i_did_a_grave_mistake_in_the_recent_past_and_now/) to do a stupid thing to save my relationship -Reddit didn't do it but suggested that I sent flowers and wait for a while. I had already thought about that and as far as I know her I knew that she would think I was bribing her into relationship. But nevertheless I went on with reddit's suggestion and [sent her some flowers](http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/enery/dear_redditors_help_me_save_my_relationship_please/) with a note saying ""I'm sorry. I love you.""  As expected, it didn't serve any good. 

Also, I waited for a week and tried to give her a call. First she didn't answer. After texting her, she did answer I tried to explain myself, I aplogized, tried to convinced her that I already understood tha tit was not a good move and didn't do it. Offered her to check my emails, phone conversations also bank account if she wanted to, but to no avail.

As you can understand, my last phone conversation with her didn't go well. (She declined my intivation for a last ""date."")

I don't know what to do at the moment. I feel like shit and all I can say to you guys that it isn't worth it. Don't try it. Just love your SO. Just fucking do it.

**Bottom line is:** I know I did a grave mistake, gf broke up with me and she's solid about that. Is there any chance that she could change her mind &amp; forgive me?

Basically her and her friends find it to be necessary to go to a club for New Years. I don't want to interfere with the planning, and I would like my GF to have a great time, but part of that would be me having a good time with her. 

The thing is I just hate clubs and most bars in my area. I don't like the music, not even a little. I don't like to get drunk anymore. I don't enjoy dancing, especially not to club music. And having to pay $50 just to get in on top of the parking fee and then another $10 for each drink I get us is a real damper on it as well as I do not have much money.

Beyond all of that, I find it difficult to keep conversation going with her friends as we mostly do not have anything in common. 

My ideal fun night would include some drinks with friends in a place where we can listen to some music like Pink Floyd or Ratatat, have a couple bowls, and talk about something interesting like the universe.

So Reddit, how does a guy like me have fun in a place like a club?

EDIT 1: For some reason people are assuming that when I do go to bars or clubs, that I just sit there pissed the whole time and bitching at my GF for bringing me. Ya'll couldn't be more wrong. What would be the point in going if I was just going to piss all over her time? I manage to strike up conversation with her friends, I manage to get on the dance floor for a bit, and I do drink to help me through it all. After every time she is pleased and I drive us home for awesome sex... The question I asked was how to make it more enjoyable for me. I suppose I was hoping for more people like me who typically don't go to clubs to suggest what they do to make their experience better.

This is also about only one girl I wanted feedback on, as I haven't been able to figure out how to make a move in this situation.

Anyway this HB7-8 (25 - 26 years old, I'm 27) works in my local pharmacy and I've always noticed her since I think she looks real cute. I haven't been in there too many times, but I've wondered how I might be able to chat her up. It's not easy in there, as there's always people waiting for their turn, and it's a number system where you don't choose who you are being served by.

The few times I've been in there, there hasn't been any flirting going on, or anything like that, but I did see her noticing me the first time. A long time passed where I haven't been in there, and I was just in there a week ago to buy some cough medicine. While I was waiting for my turn, our eyes met and she looks like she recognised me. I got the cashier next to her, and while I was talking to her, I caught the HB (with peripheral vision) checking me out 2-3 times.

I would have tried to make eye contact, but I was too engaged in my conversation; I was explaining how I got my cold from being out running on a particular cold day, and so forth.

Then today I was back there to buy some mouth wash, and also hoping to see her, and maybe see how it went. Not only was she there, but I also got her when my number was called.

I might have been imagining this, but during the whole thing I got the impression that she was a bit nervous. Especially when she saw that I was the one with her number. You know, the kind of nervous you'll maybe be yourself when talking to a hot girl and mustering the courage to ask her out.

This might not be so at all, but it was definitely a good state of mind for me thinking this about her.

I was keeping a confident frame, maintaining eye contact and mustered my best smirks throughout, but they weren't really reciprocated which was a major factor in me becoming confused about the situation.

The conversation was all business; I asked if they any of those pills you take to avoid hangovers and they didn't. I then asked if she knew where I might want to look to find those.

I punch in my PIN for payment, and ask if it's possible to get a bag from her for my mouth wash, and she says; ""Of course, I had actually already taken one out, but was in my own thoughts for a second there"".

I make a polite comment half jokingly, and says ""take care"" and am on my way again.

Normally when chatting up a girl I will be able to sense if she's interested in me even in the slightest, and my confidence will only grow the more smiles are exchanged and other IOI's. Then I would say something like ""Give me your number, then I can ask you out sometime"".

But I'm unsure of how to best proceed in closing this girl. As Mystery would say ""hired gun"". She's not overly nice though, like a hired gun would be for business, maybe she is just nervous. Still I don't know how to even take this to the next level in this circumstance.

With my cyberpolice-backtracking abilities I found her Facebook page, but I don't think that will be useful, except telling me that we have no friends in common.

250179,"So, I saw True Grit on Christmas day and thought it over for a couple of days...

First off I've got to say I absolute love all of the Coen Brothers works as well as Jeff Bridges. Though I still enjoyed the film and thought alone it was a great film, overall I was underwhelmed in comparison to the original. I find that I've come to have a very high expectation of the Coen Brothers and a lot of what makes their films great was missing in this film and I think it was because they tried to keep it true to the original. I did like several things that they did to update the film a bit and distinguish it some from the original.

I've got to say it's extremely hard to top John Wayne. There's no one else like him and I think Jeff Bridges did a great job at making his own Cogburn in the film. Though, I've got to say there were several moments in the film where I just couldn't understand what the hell he was saying. I absolutely love Jeff Bridges (saw Tron: Legacy last week, was awesome), but I just hope that the theater had audio issues and that was the reason for not understanding him.

As for Hailee Steinfeld, I thought her performance of Mattie was decent, but I didn't find it as raw of a performance as the original performed by Kim Darby. Throughout the remake, Mattie seemed pretty blunt and hardly showed any emotion. I know her character is supposed to be this brute woman that's all about settling the business of her father, but in the original you saw several incidents where emotion got the better of Mattie. I didn't really see any of this in the remake. This was probably mostly due to the age difference between the actresses of the original and the remake (but maybe that's how the Coen brothers wanted it). Hailee is more true to the age of the character while Kim Darby was actually 20 at the time of filming.

I've got to say I really did like how LaBoeuf's role in the remake of the film was made more significant. Of course it had to be when bringing a big star in like Matt Damon. In the original Glen Campbell's performance was mediocre, but he was never even an actor, so judging him as one isn't really fair and probably why his role was smaller.

I think the biggest issue I had with the film was the ending. I understand the Coen brothers wanted to make a significant difference with it because they kept true to much of the script throughout the film, but the ending was just so far fetched. I couldn't even connect to it because of a serious flaw. Throughout the story, Mattie Ross is a 14 year old girl. Then at the end it fastforwards 25 years. At this time Mattie Ross should be 39 years old and Cogburn would be well into his 80s. The woman who played Mattie Ross really shocked me. I had to look her up because she looked like she was at least 60 years old, but she happens to be only 41. Maybe women didn't age as well back then, but due to current society, I had trouble connecting. Also, with the time period it just didn't seem to click with me that Cogburn, a sheriff that always was in the line of danger, would live to be in his 80s back in the Western days and retire to a Western road show. It was just completely out of character and hard to believe he would live that long.

Overall, I found it to be a great film, just not nearly as good as the original, which is fine because topping a John Wayne film is near impossible. We must remember John Wayne also won the Oscar that year for his performance in True Grit. I thought the cinematography was wonderful in the remake and most of the acting stellar as well.

I can't come into office visits.

So my question is, is there any psychologists out there that needs a penpal? I will not lie to you about any mental state or thought, I have no reason to do so. I can't pay you but I can promise you an engaging case study. This is one of my last few ideas to break the mental stagnation.

And that thread is for advice.  Here goes:

I'm currently 25 years old, living at home with my mom.  We split the mortgage (which she has recently refinanced to stay afloat).  My mother receives a non-taxable paycheck to look after 1 person with a mental disorder for the government.

I work full time, and I give her 500$ a month for rent, buy my own groceries.  My dad left her 5 years ago, and she's been downward spiraling ever since.  

It's not just the emotional side of things (which she copes well with on most days) but when he left her, he left the house and all the bills at the same... basically walked away from all the responsibility.  He currently lives with his well-to-do mother, has already saved enough money for retirement, and uses his new-found income to go on vacation about 4 times a year.

My mother is 63 years old, and she is getting a job at a call center working full time to help make ends meet.  It makes me so angry and disappointed that my Dad can just walk away, and he is basically set up to inherit my grandmother's estate-- meanwhile my mom fights tooth and nail every day to hold on to the last piece of property that her father left to her.

She's still in love with him, and can't afford a lawyer for divorce or alimony or spousal support.

The whole situation is just heartbreaking to me.  She's such a giving woman... I give her as much money as I can but I'm also trying to save up to go to university in the fall.

I guess I am looking for some words of encouragement or some advice to help out this miserable situation.

So I'm just wondering. Why? Laziness? Disgusting personal hygiene (I've seen very clean cut people not wash their hands). Some religious reason? The number one reason I hate using public toilets is cause I'm always following some happy ass-hole (that become very offended when challenged) out that did not wash after.

**Edit:  This bothers me mostly cause i have a small kid that gets sick a lot more often now that he's doing the toilet thing himself (I make sure he's washing his hands), but before this I found it to be lazy (how long does it take to wash your hands, oh no the loss in time from your day) and disgusting (whatever method you use to avoid touching yourself when using the bathroom the rest of its not to clean either).
Some body asked how often I see people not washing their hands, I went one week at my work washroom without seeing one person wash their hands, probably 50 or 60 people.**

So far, this is what I've got, and it's basically pieced together from a Del-Ton rifle kit. It's the cheapest I could find and came recommended.

Del-Ton flat top upper, 20"" chrome lined barrel, standard front sight post post (I'm actually fond of it, but open to suggestions if someone has something better), Magpul MBUS rear iron sight, Del-Ton completed lower and a Magpul MOE carbine stock.

All told, it comes out to $760, assembled. I'm not really looking to put the upper together, and it wound up being around 30 bucks to just buy the lower completed from del-ton, an expense I'm comfortable with. Is there a way to build this gun cheaper without sacrificing quality? It's pretty no-frills as is. Even the Magpul stock was the same price as the standard A2 stock that it comes with, and the MBUS was as cheap as I'm willing to go on a rear sight.

The only way Muhammad could have done such miracles is if he was a prophet of god.

If Muhammad is a prophet of god, why are you still christian? Shouldn't you be following the tenets of Islam?

Edit:
Keatsandyeats this is for you.

First, there is significant evidence that Muhammed performed miracles, at least as much as there is for Jesus, such as splitting the moon. This is documented in various sources. It was even seen by a king in India.

Additionally there is a strong oral tradition that was then composed into the Hadith which records. The people who passed down what became the Hadith were scholars. They would not have made mistakes as they could check with each other. It would have been difficult for anyone scholar to fabricate the miracles as other scholars would have noticed, unless you are proposing a nation wide conspiracy among Muslim scholars to fabricate miracles that never happened.

For example he traveled in one night from Mecca to Jerusalem and back. We know he did this because he was able to describe the caravans he had seen on his return journey and was able to predict when they would arrive. There are similar cases where Muhammad healed the sick, multiplied food and water, and banished demons. These all have eye witness testimony.

So we know he did miracles. 

So onto, is he a prophet of god? If the miracles don't prove that I don't know what will. If miracles are not proof of a divine connection, how can you come to the conclusion that Jesus is the son of god? Please answer this question, it is important.

Additionally, he gave many prophecies that came true, such as the conquest of Istanbul and many others.

But I think the strongest piece of evidence for the veracity of Muhammad, is it brings about a contradiction if you deny his miracles as the work of someone other than god.

If someone other than god is capable of doing miracles on such a scale, then how do you know that Jesus was also divine? If Muhammad's miracles could have been the work of the devil, then miracles Jesus are also not evidence for his divinity.

pleased to meet you, i'm a respectful, honest, relaxed &amp; generally happy man, who has currently found himself in the middle of nowhere in essex &amp; with no idea of how to meet new people. seriously, this little village is weird, everybody my age has, for good reason, fucked off. so i'm looking for (in cyber-world) stimulating emails from lovely strangers, long relaxed conversations on skype, sharing a cup of tea over the webcam. a coffee, a beer or a smoke in real life would be awesome, but, on the basis that i'm fucking off to south america in just over 2 months, if things get at all sexy, there is no commitment right now.

me? working, yogaing, writing, reading, porning, interneting, kinda guy. as happy in a milan jundera book, as something filthy involving a couple of women. i have no particular issues which i need a friend or partner to take out on, something resembling balance is taking over. i've a particular interest in nlp, which means i now don't really smoke the fags (although i will) and after cutting caffeine out of my daily diet, i am now without chemical addiction of any sort. 

i aspire to be well rounded &amp; good company, i make a good chat &amp; god darn it, i will continue in preferring the company of women, except my best mate, who will insist on being male. can't really hold that against him. i can only recommend calling me on skype @ dayglovinyl, it's all free and wonderful like that, i love to hear from people all over the world. 

there is a chance i may try &amp; have sex with you, but i will do so with gentlemanly grace. no offence should be taken.

so, yea, that'd be an opening gambit, there's a lot more, for i doubt many people could happy sum themselves up in a hundred or so words &amp; die happy. or maybe i'm just not clever enough to do that.

Comcast Support Rep &gt; What do you mean?

Comcast Support Rep &gt; Is that for your internet?

jeric23_ &gt; Well, you suggested using Desktop Doctor.  It sounds like a great utility, and I would like to use it.  You said it will work on Linux, and when I looked it up, I was only able to see a download for an MSI package.

Comcast Support Rep &gt; Hold on please.

jeric23_ &gt; MSI is an acronym for MicroSoft Installer (package).  This will only work on a Windows Desktop environment.

jeric23_ &gt; I however, use a Debian based Linux operating system.

jeric23_ &gt; There is only one download link on that page, to an MSI.

Comcast Support Rep &gt; Features:
Install it and forget about it - Desktop Doctor is free, downloadable software that helps keep you connected to what's important.

Download link: http://customer.comcast.com/Pages/HelpNFC.aspx?print=false&amp;id=desktopdoctor 

Should a customer choose to uninstall this software, they should download the installer off of comcast.net and run it since it has a ""remove"" option.


The Desktop Doctor takes a ""snapshot"" of your Internet and email settings at a time when you have normal connectivity to the Internet and your email settings are functioning properly.




It remembers those settings in the event that you lose Internet connectivity or email stops working in the future. If you lose Internet connectivity or your email stops functioning, Desktop Doctor remembers your original settings.




If you lose your Internet connection, simply click on the Desktop Doctor icon and follow the simple, easy-to-understand and easy steps to get back to surfing

Because these people conclude if you are worth by some crazy customs they have created around them which are not even worth to decide your life.
But postponing the pleasure we are all seeking in this relentless world is worth. As I mentioned the ""WORLD"" it does not only consist of substances but also of human droids that make up this society. I do not have resources right now to show these droids that I am capable of something. I have follow their chosen path to make me look bigger.
What are those factors that lead these droids to force to kill the Individuality of a human child and turn them to droids?
As deep As I sense the care and affection they have for me . That much I also sense the paranoia. The paranoia that have taken over their liberal thoughts and is affecting my life.
A close friend of mine told me not to let my parent take control over my life, they will fuck it up and you will regret it later. For a time being I have to let go and do as they wish me to do..... Though it is also my choice of doing what I wanna do...... Their paranoia make them believe that it is what I want to do.....yeah it is but it is not in the way I would like to pursue this.. but since it is my only option to pursue this pathm.. I have to follow this path for some time being to prove me worth.
In the mean time I have also prepared a time table I have to follow from tomorrow and I have to be quite disciplined to follow it to pursue a short term droid path to success. Even a slight laziness and and deviation from it can lead to disaster and all these efforts might go in complete vain. There is a big competitions lying ahead that decide lives of people... Either I can be a crybaby  and bitch about it or I can fuckin nail it and then bitch about it! No matter what I am gonna bitch about I but still the latter option to me seems to be more viable..........
I know the path that I am choosing is not as good as I want it to be. The fact that I know these insane rituals of  this insane human society I am going through satisfies me and makes me sad. Because my fellow mates will pursue this unknowingly without questioning it and happily..guess this is the first customs they will be  going through that will make them Droids.  I wish their denial will break out some day and we will stop forcing a human being to become a droid.

I felt kinda bad for the guy so I give him about $4-$5 in change. And I asked him for a toke from his crack pipe.

Took two hits. And before I left I introduced myself to him. told him it was cool meeting him. I didn't get too high from the crack. But I did feel some stimulation and numbness on my lips and tongue.

So far I've volunteered for two senatorial campaigns, but my experience has been essentially relegated to phone banking and holding signs out on the streets.  I've made a few contacts, but so far I haven't been able to parlay them into anything further.

I'm facing a few challenges, which makes getting involved a little more difficult:

1.  I go to an engineering college, and most of the students and facility there aren't particularly politically motivated.  Its difficult to make connections on campus versus a liberal arts school.  Also, I have little guidance on how to break into the field.  Everything I've done I've had to figure out on my own.

2.  I began college as an engineering student, but unfortunately I was pretty terrible at it.  Although my grades have improved since switching to business I still have a 2.6 GPA, which disqualifies me from the internship programs offered by senators and representatives (they generally require at least a 3.0).

3.  I'm from Connecticut originally, so I'm fairly liberal.  I go to school in Georgia, which is pretty conservative.  It's been difficult to find candidates to work for that share similar values as I do.

I don't mean to use these challenges as excuses for not moving forward, I just want to provide a little background.  If you have any suggestions, or have any personal experience you can share, I look forward to hearing from you.

254961,"more and more lately, I've been looking at inconsistencies within the church. I had decided long ago to leave the church, but that was because of social and philosophical difference, and I had never really thought about how idiotic the churches beliefs and teachings are. this has been my most recent realization.

Growing up I was always told the story of Martin Harris losing the 116 pages. I was told that he took the pages so that his wife could read them, and understand the truth in the words. but she was filled with doubt by the Devil, and decided to hide the pages, in an attempt to discredit Joseph Smith. well God was mad at Joseph for feeling he needed to prove anything to people. and so God told Joseph that he wasn't going to allow him to re-translate those pages, but that he could translate other things, which were basically the exact same thing, but slightly different. and this proves that Joseph was for real.

so tonight I'm watching the south park episode ""All About Mormons"" and it really hit me just how messed up the above logic is. as they highlighted in the episode, if anything, that story proves that he was a fraud, and you can see that with no prior knowledge of the church. but what astonishes me, is that people can still believe Joseph's story, even when they have a ""full knowledge"" of the church.

first of all, there's the idea that God would get pissed that Joseph sent out the pages to Mrs. Harris. I thought the entire point of those translations and pages was to show people about the church, and that's exactly how they were used. I'll say it again, the ENTIRE POINT of the Book of Mormon is to (supposedly) spread the truth about Christ and his gospel, but apparently when they were used that way, God got pissed.

now even if we assume that those initial copies weren't meant to be shared until they could be copied, God is still a GIANT baby about the whole thing. he supposedly had the plates translated for the good of all mankind, but decides to say ""fuck you"" to the human race because of one man's easily fixable mistake. 

despite these obvious flaws in the story and idea, there are still so many Mormons who consider this ""proof"" that Joseph smith was for real.

Don't worry, I'm going for quality over quantity here and just want to gain from the collective knowledge you guys and gals have gathered.

I just wanted to know about different kinds of straight liquor and what are some good ones to get/look for at different stores when I have the chance/money/gullibility/stupidity to do so. Also what mixes are fun things to drink/make. Sunny D and Rum anyone? It's so good, I can't get enough.

My current drinking knowledge is shallow. So far I realize that SoCo, Cognac, Jameson, and Bacardi + Coke are absolutely delicious. 

I'm not a big fan of beer, perhaps because the best thing I've had is Sam Adams Oktoberfest and Blue Moon. Although they were good I have never really been keen to go for a beer rather than some harder fare. I guess it's just a preference such as people who prefer espresso to coffee. 

I just want to find some good brands or types of drinks that would be a good experience for me. I've heard that scotch is heavenly and smooth, but never have had any myself. Cognac is a personal favorite because of how sweet it is and how light it feels when not on fire. I also have tried Limoncello imported from Italy (My family has a distant cousin who is a nun in Sicily, and wouldn't you know it she likes to PARTY HARD and likes a spot of Limoncello with her dinner rather than wine when she visits us in the U.S.) and I have to say it was great.

Also, there's this place near my humble abode called the ""Fat Cat"" that makes some drinks that sound like they would taste Godlike. I haven't had them yet, but they looked like the kind of thing that you could make at home and get all your friends coming over every weekend for if you got the mixes right. Don't believe me?

255231,"Reddit is always a boatfull of help, so I'm appealing to your guidance. I'm an American looking to study abroad in Germany--or any other German-speaking country--Fall/Spring term of 2011 or '12 respectively. I'm open just about anything, whether a semester or a year long.

I have taken 4 1/2 years of German classes (3 in high school and I'm finishing my second year of college). I feel like I've gotten as far as I can in a classroom. I need to immerse myself.

So far, I have worked my way through school and I don't have any loans. I'd like to keep it that way if possible. I've talked to my university's adviser on the subject, but she only knew of programs and scholarships directly affiliated with the school. I already have researched those routes.

I'm wondering if any of you have any experience as an American studying in Germany. Specifically, I'm wondering how you financed your time there and if you have any advice.

I'll give you more details if you want them.

**TL;DR** How do I get money to study abroad in Germany?

This is mainly for those of you who point to the miracles(and resurrection) performed by Jesus as evidence for his divinity.

I'd say that the documentation of miracles in both cases is about the same. Jesus's miracles being documented in the Gospels and Muhammad's in the Quaran/Hadith.

If you accept any Jesus's miracles as being true(resurrection included), why or why not do you accept Muhammad's miracles as being true?

255439,"I was raised as a typical middle class non-denominational protestant Christian in the American bible belt. Love thy neighbor (unless they are homosexual or otherwise ungodly), love god, abstinence, pro-life, anti-homosexual, Republican, etc. As one would expect, I had christian friends, went to church every Sunday and made lots of nonsensical, irrational arguments to people who disagreed with me.


Then puberty hit. I started to want to do many things that I had been strictly told were evil, poisonous acts. So, I repressed. And repressed. Eventually I got to those teenage rebellion years and with them came the desire to disagree with anything told to me by authority. So, long story short, I lost my virginity when I was 17. And I hate to admit it but afterward I was torn up inside, almost on the verge of tears. I began to ask myself why I would be given such a strong desire to do things that are clearly stated as sin. Eventually I blamed god. I rebelled. I figured I had found a loophole in god's rules and as long as I continued to believe I could do whatever I wanted and still make it to heaven. I felt horrible and guilty all the while, but my desires would never go away.


Fast forward about a year. At this point, I'm starting to question. I'm starting to doubt. I know there is all this information available about the true nature of things around me but I refused to investigate. The truth is, I was scared. I didn't want to be convinced that the Christian god wasn't real because if I stopped believing then I would be headed straight to hell. Eventually I couldn't help it any more and I began to research. I rationalized this by telling myself that I wanted to ""see how stupid it was"" or ""understand my opponents position."" In the end, being an intelligent and logical type of person, reason beat out indoctrination. 


Almost three years later and here I am today. I maintain a position as an agnostic atheist who, while open to the idea of higher beings, understands that there is no proof of existence of a god/gods and all religions that have existed to this point are inaccurate representations of a deity. I think critically and hold my life and the lives of my fellow man above all things. Essentially, I have become a productive member of humanity looking to improve the world as a whole rather than hold it back. This all started with me wanting to rebel against god. 


I guess what I'm trying to say is that when someone claims to rebel against god is not the time to scoff at their beliefs. Guilt is a powerful emotion and I believed in god more during that period of rebellion than I had at any other point in my life because I felt like he was actively judging me. At least in my case, this is the time to talk, in a calm and thoughtful manner, about the believers views.


In closing of this extremely long winded babbling, my point is that these people need to realize why their guilt does not originate from a god but from the sect of society that they were raised in. Atheism is not the end goal. An agnostic theist can be just as humanistic as an agnostic atheist. As long as people are thinking critically about morality and the causation of actions and not clinging to archaic rulebooks then society can move forward as it should. 


**tl;dr** I babble about my personal life for a little bit before getting to my point: Those rebelling against god generally feel guilt for their actions due to their belief in their specific god. If they are spoken to, not argued against, about these beliefs they may come to realize (as I did) that they have nothing to feel guilty about and can start to better understand the nature and needs of humanity, whether they remain theistic or not.",1,-1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
255495,"I'm not sure what rank I am because I share accounts with a friend. My friend is a top platinum player so he doesn't let me play 1v1 with real people, just the computer (lol). I play against ""very hard"" (what ranking is that btw?)

I play zerg and have been playing for a few months now. I watch pro games, day9, and read /r/starcraft etc so I'm aware of the common builds today; what works and what generally doesn't work. I keep my money very low, usually in the first mins where all the early rushes happen I have absolutely no money. Even in the early mid game I have very little money. So spending money is not the problem.

My macro is pretty good. I usually start out with 6-8 roaches (and I wouldn't get lings) and push out from there. But when I'd reach the base, my opponent would already have this massive army that would be bigger than mine by 10-25%, just a tiny bit more. Enough to kill it before I can retreat.

Usually, this is what would happen:

I'd start out fine, breaking out drones for the first few larvae. I'd do 13pool and 15gas. As soon as my pool finishes, I start a queen and a roach warren. My roach warren would finish first, so I'd wait till the queen pops out before roach production. No expansion yet, I'm spending all of my money on drones at this time.

The queen comes out and immediately vomits on the hatch. I start roach production. Few seconds later, I'd have 6-8 roaches and as soon as they pop I move out. In the past, I had trouble with early rushes so I learned to make a roach warren faster. I'd arrive at the base and they'd, somehow, have a slightly larger army than mine. I'd lose all my units and start more roaches back at the hatch (by this time I would have my 2nd hatch up and running). I might shoot some spine crawlers here and there but by the time my enemy's army comes it would be about 4/5 done so it'd die before doing anything. The enemy would kill my 2nd hatch while I'm frantically making roaches anywhere  I can. Then the roaches would come in little groups because I'd either have to wait for larvae or more minerals. And that would be end game, when the enemy successfully kills each group of roaches that comes out and I'd be left with nothing.

What am I doing wrong? What should I be focusing on? I'm wondering if I should produce more drones and less units, but then I'd be prone to early rushes (which the A1 seems to enjoy doing...). Even 14pool is a bit too late, because by that time the enemy would have started unit production before me.

I already feel kind of like a jackass for even asking - I know there are people out there with worse problems than mine, but here goes.

The week before Christmas I got dumped by my girlfriend of 18 months.  Yes, I know, not even 2 years.  It still hurts.  Over the past few months it seemed like nothing I could do was good enough for her.  I finally found a job a few months ago (I was unemployed when we met), I had a challenging semester (group projects FTW!) and my mother got sick (she's doing better now btw).  Every time I would leave cookie crumbs on the counter or forget to change out the toilet paper or not wash a dish to her specifications or even make some off-hand remark that didn't sit quite right with her I would be accused of everything from not respecting her to cheating on her.  Every time she would make impossible demands (as there are only 24 hours in a day and I do require sleep) and I would jump through flaming hoops just to make her happy.  Every time it got worse and worse.

A couple of weeks ago I had JUST finished my last final exam of the semester (40+ hrs / week on salary + night classes).  As soon as I got out of the classroom I sent her a text asking what she was doing.  She responded that she was going to a local bar to watch a basketball game.  I told her that I was on my way and that I could not wait to see her.  Our normal routine (she works 40+ hrs / week as well) is usually seeing each other 1-2 nights during the week and spending the entire weekend together.  We tried (briefly) living together but that went over like a lead balloon.  I raced to the bar and waited for her to pull up.  As soon as she got there I jumped out of the car to give her a hug.  We went inside, found a good place to watch the game and ordered our drinks.  She and I had planned to have our Christmas on Saturday night (Dec 18) because she was going to visit her family in another state and I was planning on seeing MY family in another state.  Before our beers had arrived I said, ""Oh yeah - some friends of ours sent me a message today saying that they were going to spend Saturday afternoon delivering presents to everyone and wanted to know if we would be at your place so they could drop it off.  I told them yes, but don't worry - I'll go out and get something for us to give to them.""

She went absolutely APESHIT.  Now, what would have happened is they would have knocked on the door, said, ""Happy Holidays!"", given us the gift and we would have said, ""Same to ya!"" and given them their gift.  Takes 2 minutes tops.  According to my ex, I had INVITED them over to OUR PRIVATE CHRISTMAS, which meant that I had NO RESPECT for her and I obviously did NOT have ANY interesting in spending time with her at all.  She told me that it was over and that she deserved someone better than me.

I have heard that phrase so much over the past 6 months that it is the only thing I hear whenever I think about her.  My confidence is completely shot and I'm trying like hell to concentrate on the things that most normal people do without any effort (fold laundry, eat dinner, brush my teeth, shower, etc).  She's pulled this crap with me a couple of times and I always take her back when she calls me up crying.  This time, however, I noticed a facebook update from her not 24 hours after she dumped me.  She posted on a mutual friends' wall that she had cleared up her weekend plans and would love to attend her party.  I'm not the smartest guy in the world, but I'm pretty sure that she was planning on going to that party all along but she didn't want me to be in the picture.  What I need from you guys is to tell me that it *will* get better and for God's sake PLEASE TELL ME NOT TO CONTACT HER.  Like the subject line says - I know that I am better off without her, I just need some help getting through this.

255993,"So i've created this post, I'm not sure why exactly, and posted it to the places that maybe my musings can maybe reach someone who needs it.  I'm currently in school as a Psych major working towards a BA in Psychology, masters in Social work with a focus in Substance abuse.  I watch Intervention every week it's on, i consider it training, and saw an episode tonight that spoke to me.
A little more background about me.  The end of 2005 was not a banner year in the PantsAreOptinoal household.  I just got out of a 6 year relationship, i was depressed, felt unloved, i was about to turn 26 in a week and I felt like my life was going nowhere.  I wound up with another woman in Aprilish of 2006 and to say it was a emotionally bad relationship would be putting it lightly.  It lead to a huge depression, which transitioned into anxiety and panic attacks and by the end of 2006 I was a shell of a man.  I had hit bottom and i was sure it hated me too.  By 2007 I was depressed, thoughts of suicide ran in and out of my head on a regular basis but i knew it wasn't a solution, just an easy way out.  In 2006 and 2007 i was as depressed as you can get without ending it, i was having 3-4 panic attacks a day on a slow day and crying uncontrollably.  in 2 years time I left my house probably twice.  Both times I was doped out of my mind so i could get out and to a doctor.  I tried to pushy myself to just walk out to my back deck and every time, i would throw up just at the thought of it.  


All hope was lost until one day, for whatever reason, i was crying my eyes out yet again and screaming loudly how i hated what my life had become.  Then i realized, i need help.  I cant fight this, whatever it was, demon for lack of a better word, without help.  it took 4 months to do it and me getting high out of my mind pretty much and my mother driving me, but i finally went to a therapist.  My therapist decided I should take some paxil to help and group therapy.  ""Hello, i have anxiety about groups of people? Fucking group therapy? Where did you graduate from? Wal-mart!?"".  Thankfully she knew more then me.  I started group and after the first meeting, driving myself there.  After just 6 months I could see the massive change that was happening for the good.  It's coming up on 3 years and i'm better then i was even before I realized i was starting to feel depressed.  I don't have group anymore, i'm off my meds and if I stay home for more than a day or two, i get cabin fever.


""So what the hell is the point in this post man? You are better, why are you posting here?""  Glad you asked.  I hope this finds someone that is at this time in their life.  Maybe more than 1.  I want you to know, wheover you are.  It can get better.  No matter how hopeless it seems, how bleak and black your future looks, stick with it.  You'll reach a point like I did.  Where you finally say ""I fucking had enough of this.  It's time I took my damn life back from this demon"" and you start doing it.  Group may be your answer, maybe meds, maybe neither but your answer is out there.  Keep looking. Do NOT give up.  We all have a purpose though you don't feel it or see it right now.  Me?  I went back to school, changed my major to Psychology and want to give back like that.  Maybe my purpose was to live through what I did so i can help others just as those who went before me reached out to me.  It's not a hyperbole to say, they literally saved my life.  You're worth saving.  Get help.

I just skyped with them and they are drinking and laughing and apparently having a great time. I know my girlfriend, and I know she has a tendency to be really slutty (flirt/ snuggle with other guys) when she drinks. I asked if my friend was sleeping over and he said he didn't know.

256613,"TL;DR

I’m a 22-year-old guy in an LDR (3 hours away). My girlfriend is getting stressed about the distance, and pressuring me to make definitive statements about our future and getting married. Only problem is, she’s cheated twice. I can’t bring this up to her because then I’m harping on the past.

I should probably break up with her, but she was my first everything, and I have some trouble making friends. I have zero experience with dating, and I’m not looking forward to being very alone. She’s also very beautiful (way out of my league), and this doesn’t make it easy to talk to her about breaking up. She’s very serious about our relationship and she’s always seen her future with me since she met me. Meanwhile, we don’t fight, but we don’t have a lot in common, either. Especially when I get close to thinking about breaking up, she gets very affectionate and I try to solve our problems.

Obviously, I'm not in the right when I've felt this way for so long without telling her. But being honest about this would be the same thing as breaking up with her, and that's what I'm having trouble doing. I would love to just do this amicably, but that can't happen with her.

What should I do? Should I try to settle? Should I break up with her? Should I keep on keepin’ on? I just want some objective voices on this.

==

She is my first girlfriend. We started dating when we were 18, and we've been dating for three years. She was my first everything (first date, first kiss, everything). I wasn't her first anything: She'd had a few boyfriends, but only one serious one. She is way hotter than a guy like me could ever hope to date (again).

We met during freshman year in college while she was dating her first serious boyfriend (she'd been dating him for a year). We started hanging out with a few mutual friends, and eventually we had a talk. She told me she loved me and kissed me. I felt it was wrong, and I didn't kiss back. I broke off the ""friendship,"" and told her that her relationship with him needed to stand or fall on its own merits. We didn't talk that summer, but by september her boyfriend was out of the picture and we were dating.

She traveled abroad during spring semester that year. We didn't have too much trouble with the LDR until the summer (we live far away from each other during the summer). That summer, she started hanging out with a guy at her work, and she felt disconnected from me since we were so far away, and pressured about how fixed our future together seemed. I found out that fall that she'd kissed him (and basically fallen for him). She apologized profusely, but eventually shifted blame on to how disconnected we were, making me feel bad. I didn't break it off. Every time I would bring it up, she would accuse me of ""not letting it go"" and trying to make her feel bad.

We don't have a lot of activities or interests in common. We have inside jokes that we can laugh about, but mostly we get by on listening to each others' problems. Superficially, though, we're great: we can be very romantic and, when we get the chance, our physical relationship is positively amazing.

Fast-forward to almost three years into our relationship: she's come out to see with my family. I planned to talk with her about our future, or lack thereof. Somewhere between her smile, her romantic talk, the beach, and talking away our problems I get energized about our future for the first time since she cheated.

Then we get drunk. She's incoherent. I'm less so. She's waiting on a text from her friend (a girl) and keeps talking about it, but she's in no shape to read. I never would invade her privacy under normal conditions. But now, I read her phone. First text: ""Hi honey."" Not from me.

So as it turns out, after a party she accepted a ride home, or should I say to *his* home, from a (different) work friend, this one thirty years old (we're 22). She'd thrown up on her dress, so he gave her his to wear, and they slept in the same bed while he kissed her back. I'm supposed to believe that that's all that happened, and I almost do. The next couple of days, she texts him niceties back and forth like the above, and visits his house and hangs out with his kids (!) and watches TV with him. Then, she comes on vacation with me.

Amazingly, I don't dump her. Not amazingly, she apologizes but ""explains"" herself and tries to excuse her behavior, and then gets mad at me for reading her texts. Again, god forbid I bring it up ever again; I must just ""let it go.""

We were staying with my parents at the time, and they basically figured everything out. They already had a bad feeling about her, but now they know everything, and they don't like her to say the least. (Meanwhile, her family is crazy about me.)

We had a big talk in september, where I tried to talk her into either breaking up amiably or taking a break. I discussed our problems (instead of saying ""cheating"" I say something about how disconnected we get when we're apart, how we don't talk about anything substantial, etc.). It becomes clear after a LONG talk that if we break up, it won't be amiable and it will be my fault. She equates taking a break to breaking up, so I try to talk her into a ""probation period."" Still too serious-sounding. Nothing changes.

It's now a few months later. We're both graduated, she has a job, and I'm in grad school three hours away. She's hating being so far apart, but she loves playing ""house"" when she visits me in my apartment. She has friends at home, but no eligible guys at her new job. Now she's saying that time is running out: she wants to know from me that we have a future together, that we're going to get married. Her friends are getting married and her relatives are asking about us.

She can be really romantic and really passionately sexual, and she is especially this way when I'm less enthused about our relationship. (Most of the rest of the time, she's just unhappy.) Seeing her face still entrances me. I'm a problem-solver, and I like to work things out. I don't want her walking away and vilifying me. But I think marriage would be a really bad idea, if only for the fact that she'd get miserable pretty quick, if history is any indication!

She has had some trauma in her life; she lost her mother when she was young. I don't think she's been single for more than a few days since high school. Meanwhile, I didn't know any girls in my all-boys high school, and I'm not a very interesting person: I've successfully cut myself off from my bad habits and interests (video games, television, cracked.com, etc.), but I haven't been super-successful at replacing them with new ones. I have some friends at school, but I range somewhere between ""a little"" and ""only somewhat"" socially awkward.

I would be giving up romance, sex, and someone who knows me pretty well, and I might not get anything like this again for a very long time. Of course these are terrible reasons to stay with someone, but sometimes I wonder if I shouldn't just settle and do my best. Sure there are a lot of people out there, but there are some people who just don't find the right person ever.

Part of the problem is that I am a problem-solver: I mend things up between people and make things okay again. I am pretty sure any break-up couldn't be amiable, so that means I would have to look at that face of hers and tell her we're over. This is very difficult.

Plus, obviously, I really care about her and I don't want to hurt her. This is tough all around.

257677,"I don't know Reddit ... I almost feel like I've been living a complete lie the past year or so.

So, here's the gist of it all: About half-way through my Junior year of highschool, I was told I wouldn't be able to graduate on time. With my current grades, and my GPA, they told me it wouldn't be possible. So, me and my dad talked (My parents are divorced, it's kind of confusing), and he said I could move over to his place and get my GED (He offered to pay for it, my mom couldn't). Of course, me being my stupid self and not planning ahead, decided to go along with it. I was never really that into highschool, I wasn't very popular, and a lot of my ""friends"" I didn't even get along with, so I thought what the hell. It's worth a shot, right?

Now, here I am, 6 months later, sitting on my ass all day and night with nothing to do, trapped with a family I don't even like.

I *need* to be all these things that I'm not -- and yet, my dad gives me a hard time about not having a job; I almost feel like he wants me to be something that I'm not, and the whole reason why he let me in was because he wanted to spend time with me and that's it. I'm 17 and eventually I'm going to need to pay for college when I turn 18, and I have no idea where I want to go once I'm out on my own.

257764,"So I picked up this book, “Zero: The Biography of a Dangerous Idea” by Charles Seife, at Fry's the other day and started reading it this morning at 3AM. Pretty interesting stuff. What struck me the most out of the first few chapters was how Western civilization just banished away the concept of zero and infinity because of religion and philosophy. The story goes something like this: the Greeks had a philosophical belief against zero as it represented the void and the infinite, two unacceptable concepts.

Pythagoras killed Hippasus over the concept of zero, seeing it as dangerous because it ruined the natural beauty of rational numbers. Then Aristotelians, Atomists, and the Eleatic school had this huge three-way fight over whether zero and infinity could not exist, whether it existed, or whether zero and infinity were the same. And then the Aristotelians won because the lack of infinity would prove the existence of God, fitting into later Western civilization; to question the non-existence of zero was questioning the existence of God.

But then zero is the fundamental concept in Calculus; zero defines the limit. In the most basic form, motion can be defined as an infinite number of zero-length steps. The sum of these steps is not zero, but it’s actually a number; this is the limit. Because zero was paramount to being atheist, and that was a big no-no in Europe, Calculus wouldn’t get invented until the 17th century when scientists such as Newton and Leibniz started questioning the religious doctrines.

So all the religious-right groups could be stifling the next great mathematical (or I guess, biological/physical?) discoveries much like the Greeks and the European churches stifled the discovery of Calculus (though I'm sure many AP Calculus students would love to not have Calculus around)",-1,-1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Chattanooga tn, as i was walking into the store i notices an abundance 
of ice in the parking lot, no salt or sand on top of it . there was some
salt on the concrete entryway but none in the parking lot per say. 
Myself and my friend both commented that there should be salt or at 
least a caution sign. I then told the cashier Brenda whom i have known 
for about 8 years in a joking manner that i could sue if i had slipped 
and fallen and there should be salt on the ice in the parking lot , she 
laughed, along with a few customers in line, and told me to be nice. i 
was an employee for 3 years and we got on very well. then i went to look
for items for my aquarium. as i turned the assistant manager told Brenda
that it would be my fault if i fell and not Petsmarts. assuming that i 
could not hear him my friend as well heard this statement. In my 
experience with working with the company in the past i was always told 
that the costumer was always right and to never back talk, at least in 
the presence of the costumer, As a result of the snideness of the said 
manager i then went to Brenda and told her that i was about to spend 
alot of money for my aquarium and then told her to let the manager know 
that he just lost a large sale because of his mouth.I then went across 
the street to PETCO and spent $158.62 on various items for my aquarium. 
I told the employees as well as the manages at PETCO what had transpired
at Petsmart, they said that they were happy to serve me and even gave me
a 15% discount on my purchase.  i am very disappointed with the level of
customer service at the Chattanooga petsmart at Hamilton place  and be 
assured that i will let everyone i come in contact with not to shop at 
Petsmart.

Judging from the price I realise there is quite the possibility that it was not genuine but I bought it anyway. 

Now I'm realising that in a few weeks I'll be travelling through Germany where they obviously hate the Nazis. I've looked it up and I'm aware that its illegal to sell/buy Nazi items in Germany and a few other countries but nothing about possessing. 

I would obviously leave it in my backpack and it would not see the light of day until I get back home. However obviously I am a bit paranoid due to having no wish to end up on jail in Germany for the possession of a pocket watch.

259149,"""So why do most men avoid church? Here’s the veneer-stripped-away answer: going to church for the majority of men is an exercise in unwanted effeminacy. Church, for most men, has not only become irrelevant; it has also become effeminate. Hanging out in church for most Y chromosomes seems unmanly, and most men more than anything want to be masculine! 

The current lack of strong men within the Church, both in the numeric and leadership sense, has crippled our cathedrals and has helped devastate our nation ethically. The masculine spirit being absent from the pulpit, the pew and subsequently the public square has not only slowed down the forward progress of the Church, it has also weakened our nation’s morality, increased our country’s secularity, and has assisted (owing to our absence) the lascivious Left’s re-definition of life, sex, marriage and law. 
If the body of Christ wants to biblically improve our nation, then church has got to eliminate its effeminate drift and establish a masculine bent. Our times demand strong men and the church should be producing them and not repelling them.""

So I started talking to this girl on okcupid about Dec 20th. Between then and now we've sent over 30 long and funny messages to each other, it seemed like it was going really well. She was being receptive, laughing at my jokes, and initating contact with me. I asked her to coffee and she said it would probably be best to meet up after the whole christmas season thing winds down, that was fine. I even got her phone number and we were texting back and forth as well. It really looked like she was genuinely interested in meeting, if nothing else.

Then she deleted her account, basically in the middle of our conversation. She never said she didn't want to meet, she never implied that she was not interested. It was probably the most promising string of communication I've had with a woman in a long time. I sent her a text asking if she was still up for coffee, nothing back. Haven't heard from her since then. That's fine, things happen.

But I don't exactly want to leave it there. If she didn't want to meet me, she could have said so and I wouldn't be too upset about it. Here is the creepy part...

Bear with me here. 
I want to go by her workplace and bring her some flowers and just ask if she'd still be willing to go for coffee. If she tells me no and to ""fuck off creep"", that's fine, she'll never see me again. No big deal to me. The part I am worried about is.. she never really explicitly told me where she worked. I have a friend who met her a few years ago and recognized her from the picture she had up, that's how I know where she worked. I know, creepy. 

I was going to say ""Hey, I know this is weird and creepy and stuff but I wanted to know if you were still interested in doing coffee sometime. If not, I understand and you will never see me again, it was nice talking to you.""

I can understand that this would generally be perceived as a creepy stalkerish thing to do. I have no intentions of ""stalking"" this girl, I have better things to do with my life. She's really interesting and we have lots in common and I just want to know why she stopped communicating. 

My question is, would any ladies find a well dressed professional guy (Mid 20's) coming by their work unannounced with flowers and asking them to coffee romantic?

259895,"I'm finally ready to lose weight. The short version of my life story is this -- I've always been overweight by around 30 pounds. My sophmore year of college I got motivated to lose the weight and dropped 50 pounds by eating better and exercising consistently. I'm about 6 foot and I dropped from 230 lbs to 180 lbs from October 2007 to June 2008. But starting in July 2008 I began to put it all back on and returned to 230. Then in Jan 2010 I moved home after graduating and gained a shitload of weight. It was trifecta of terribleness -- I ate to cope with lonliness, boredom, and because there were always snacks available.


Well, I'm finally ready to stop that and start the weight loss journey again. I don’t like being fat. I look ugly and feel negative about myself. My self-esteem is low and I have a hard time imagining girls being interested in me. I’m uncomfortable sitting and standing. I’m ashamed to see people after long absences because I know how much weight I’ve gained. In addition, I like being in shape. I enjoy exercise and feeling good about myself. I enjoy looking nice and playing sports/being active. I like feeling good about myself and feeling comfortable in my body. And I have a lot of nice clothes that only fit the smaller me that I'd like to be able to wear again.

I'm thinking of doing the low carb diet -- I've seen it work very well for my dad over the past year and it allows me to eat a lot of foods I like/that taste good. And there are lots of resources to plan menus that are creative and not boring. When I lost 50 pounds the first time I did it by eating almost solely salad for months. I know that's not sustainable for a lifetime (at least not for me). I'm going to manage my food intake by setting a calorie and carb budgeted menu and only buying those foods -- not eating out alone and not keeping snack foods in the apartment (I live by myself now). Cutting soda and fast food alone should help a *ton* as I ate out 5 or more times a week for the past few months. 

I have a good friend who also wants to lose weight and we'll be going to the gym together. We will also be keeping track of food intake together on a shared google doc, so there will be plenty of accountability and encouragement. I'm hoping by changing my diet and embracing a more active lifestyle (and again, I do enjoy exercise!) I will be able to lose weight again, but this time in a way that is lasting.

Any advice or encouragement you guys might have would be very welcome.

TL;DR -- I lost a lot of weight once but put it back on and much more. I'm finally ready to start again (I'm starting today, not waiting til New Year's :P).",-1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-1,-1,-1,0,-1,-1,0,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-1,-1,-1,0,-1,-1,0,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1

Today I noticed that after being on the machine for a while my monitor decided to just go out.  I tried replugging the DVI connector, fixing the LCD screen, everything...but no luck.  So I tried restarting my machine and this time the fans turned on to full speed, but I never got my POST beep (nor any visual output).  The machine just halts at this point, though I can still eject my DVD drive if I wish.

It seems like there may be a PSU problem going on, but I'm not sure...especially since all of my fans turn on and the DVD drive will eject.

Can anyone help my diagnose this further?

261949,"Hey all,

Looking for some tips and tricks for use of ULONG/USHORT in C - if statements, how do they work? Especially since I'm not really sure if the values are, for example, ""06"" or just ""6"", so if I wanted to do a comparison would it be ""if (MYUSHORTVAR == 06)"" or would it be ""if (MYUSHORTVAR == 6)""; I think it would be the latter, but any tips would be nice.

Plus, what are the right ways to do printf/dbgprint outputs of these types? All I know is I can use %d OR %02u, while %02x works with UCHAR.

Finally, I'm using a RAND() function and it's not...random at all. It's 100% predictable. What's up with that? I did #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;...

Exact line of code is: 

ChannelNumb = (USHORT)((11*rand()/RAND_MAX+1.0))); //gen a random integer between 0 and 11, then convert to USHORT type.

This is ALWAYS making a 0 first, then a 6, then a 2, then an 8. Not really random. Why?

261980,"So I bought an HTC Desire from Kuwait. I have soooo many questions which I have googled and found no answers to. I would really, really appreciate any help I can get, since I'm in Jordan right now and the internet is so slow that some (actually most) sites won't even load.

So:

* The phone came pre-loaded with two input and phone languages: English and Arabic. I would like to add German to those. How do I do that?

* I've set up my Gmail account, now all the contacts are showing. That's pretty awesome, but how does this work exactly? I have some unwanted contacts on there. Does this automatically keep synching with Gmail (so that if I update my address book I get the new contacts on my phone)?

* The ""People"" widget... I thought it was more or less a form of quick-dialing. I can only add an entire group of people to it, not single contacts. Am I doing something wrong? 

* I'm using a MacBook Pro. On the HTC site there is only software for Windows. Do I need to run it on a different PC?

* Can you recommend some widgets and apps (sorryyyy, I know this must have been asked a million times but I thought I might as well).

* I have used an iPhone before. Besides that, not much experience with smart phones. Is there an Android 101 list or something like that I can read? Can you maybe give me a few tips on things I should know and general pointers?

**EDIT:** Another couple of points I thought of: 

* How can I update the software/firmware on my phone, seeing I don't have the software on my Mac?

* Is there anyway I can have the date displayed in the top bar where the notifications and what not are on?

Chpt 4.  Second paragraph.

And when Jesus was **five** years old, there fell a great rain upon the earth, and the boy Jesus walked up and down through it. And there was a terrible rain, and He collected it into a fish-pond, and ordered it by His word to become clear. And immediately it became so. Again He took of the clay which was of that fish-pond, and made of it to the number of twelve sparrows. And it was the Sabbath when Jesus did this among the boys of the Jews. And the boys of the Jews went away, and said to Joseph His father: Behold, thy son was playing along with us, and he took clay and made sparrows, which it was not lawful to do on the Sabbath; and he has broken it. And Joseph went away to the boy Jesus, and said to Him: Why hast thou done this, which it was not lawful to do on the Sabbath? And Jesus opened His hands, and ordered the sparrows, saying: Go up into the air, and fly; nobody shall kill you. And they flew, and began to cry out, and praise God Almighty. And the Jews seeing what had happened, wondered, and went away and told the miracles which Jesus had done. **But a Pharisee who was with Jesus took an olive branch, and began to let the water out of the fountain which Jesus had made. And when Jesus saw this, He said to him in a rage: Thou impious and ignorant Sodomite, what harm have my works the fountains of water done thee? Behold, thou shalt become like a dry tree, having neither roots, nor leaves, nor fruit. And immediately he dried up, and fell to the ground, and died.** And his parents took him away dead, and reproached Joseph, saying: See what thy son has done; teach him to pray, and not to blaspheme.

263656,"I'm sort of new to this whole Reddit thing so I'll start with: Hey.

I would just like to say that in no way am I ungrateful to be in my situation.  It took me forever to find a job and I fully appreciate how difficult it is at the moment to get one... I just happen to find myself in these circumstances at the moment.  

I'm 18 and I'm on a gap year before I wander off to university next year.  I'm currently working in a job that I LOVE.  Seriously, I love everything about it.  I love the people that I work with, I love actually working there, I love the people I work for... couldn't ask for a more enjoyable job even though shifts can go past the 15 hour mark regularly.  However, I work there casually, so I'm never guaranteed  shifts each week. I literally get told a couple of days before I'm due to work there, so some weeks may be busy, but others I might not work at all.  
The main reason I'm working is to get as much money together as I can to help with university (whining about the government changes isn't going to get me anywhere so I'm just going to do as much as I can to help myself.  But that's a different story...).  The pay for the job isn't amazing, but it gets me through and I have a bit each week that I can put into savings.  
BUT, I've just been offered another job.  This job is Monday-Friday, 9-5, week in, week out, and the pay is better (nearly twice the amount)... but I won't be enjoying my time as much as before.
So basically, I don't know what to do.  Obviously my parents are pushing me towards the high paid and regular job, but I enjoy the other one so much.

So Reddit, if you were in my situation what would you do?  Any advice would be great as I'm not sure what route to take.",1,-1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-1,-1,-1,0,-1,-1,0,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-1,-1,-1,0,-1,-1,0,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1

So then he returns and tells me to follow him to some alley way and tries to assure me he knows his shit in really bad english. we get to the alley and he starts packing my nugget in his ghetto aluminum foil crackpipe bowl. we start walking down all sketchy-like, and hit it a couple times. we then get near the end and i hit it, and realize theres a cop stationed RIGHT in front of us. 

so then we turn around and i notice we had been smoking in front of another cop. i dont know how shit works here, but i freak out because its minimum 15 years here in the philippines, so we start walking back, with me pacing quickly and sketchy-like haha. we get back to his shop and he insists on giving me skimboarding lessons (and its like 9pm and i have jeans/shoes on) so im like nahhh im gonna go to a bar and get some brews

i say thanks and dip the fuck away from sketchy-mcgee. so im like [4] and walking down the strip and this filipina bartender that served me and my atv instructor drinks earlier calls out my name. she says there's a fire show on the beach, and i look into her tent setup, and theres hookah and sweet couches and a decently priced bar menu, so im like yeaahhhh

i sit down get some shots and some beers and burn like 40 minutes waiting for the fire show. looking around, im the only one just chilling since most other people came with friends from home. it wasnt a very social scene so i just chilled forever arone. then the fire-dancers start preparing and i notice one of them looks like a tranny, and then there was a dude, and a chick. all of them dressed in tight tiny spandex outfits. 

all the while, im getting twisted, smoking a cig, and jamming the fuck out to the techno they were blasting. the show then starts and its really fucking intense. they were spinning the fire balls and it was pretty cool, and then the dude lights my cig by spinning the fireballs in my face. after the song finishes, he sits next to me, and in starts talking to me. 

im not really sure if it was in a filipino hospitality way, or if he was hitting on me, but it was awkward nonetheless. then they continue their show and i cheer with the crowd when the girl dancer unzips her outer layer when she got hot from spinning giant balls of flame around herself. the dude dancer sits back next to me again, and points out that she is in fact a ""ladyboy"" and comments on how convincing zie looks lol

then the ""girl"" starts dancing in front of me and waving her ass in my face and sits down and same kind of weird filipino hospitality and/or hitting on me. zie and the dude both tell me they wanna party with me after the show, and im nice so im like ""yeah sure sounds cool dude."" then the finale of the show happens and they put a chair on stage. 

then the ""girl"" pulls me from the crowd and starts dancing against me, sits me on the chair, kisses my cheek, and then the dude starts waving the flame balls all around me as apart of the show. i pay my bill after the finale and go to the bathroom. 

they then intercept me en route and insist i go party with them. me still being nice, im like ""uhh yeah sure!"" so then i go piss and stealth my way out of the area. i then packed some nugget into the tip of my cig, smoke it in front of another cop, and chill on the beach staring at the stars at a [5]. so yeah, it was an interesting and fun and weird night. shit like that only happens when you are high 

TL,DR: Tried to score weed on a Filippino island. Sketchy shit ensues. Tranny fire-dancers decide they like me and give me strange amounts of attention. I have fun and go about my business and stare at stars while twisted, and good times were had by all. 

Note: It's really sketchy to go with any random people as an inglesero in the Philippines.

264621,"Note: This is a DA (does anyone) post, not a DAE (does anyone else) post because I don't really stay updated with pro sports.

I love playing sports, but I think the whole fascination with watching professional sports games, keeping up to date with the teams/athletes, and deriving joy/sorrow from their accomplishments/failures is stupid. I don't mean this in a condescending way. I mean I understand it to a certain extent. I go to a college with a great football team and when my team is playing on TV, I'll usually try to catch at least the ending of the game. But honestly the only reason I watch the games is because 1. everyone else watches them so watching itself tends to be a social event 2. people will think I'm a loser if I didn't know that yesterday we won or lost to [insert significant team]. After I graduate, I'm 99% sure I won't even make the minimal effort anymore. 

Also I can only tolerate watching my *college* team play now. The other day I was watching my home NFL team play and I was bored to death. I literally couldn't care less about how well (or in my case, how *bad* they're doing since the Redskins suck) my NFL team is doing. I cared when I was like 9-14 years old and it was all new to me, but after seeing so many seasons go by and so many new players come and go, I don't understand how anyone can still give a shit. The exception being if we're close to winning a Super Bowl or something. But even that probably gets old after the first time. When Randy Moss is on some team that's not the Vikings and Michael Vick isn't on the Falcons, something just doesn't feel right to me. 

Somewhat irrelevant tangent:
*Or maybe it's just because I hate American football and think it's the dumbest sport ever. But hey I'm biased, I'm naturally a skinny featherweight so I have 0 potential to play competitive football. Even if I was extraordinarily athletically gifted, I would never make it in the NFL, or even the NCAA, because I'm 5'10 and 140 lbs. Take any random overweight slob and at least he has the potential to be a lineman or something.*

But even when it comes to college sports, I don't know nearly enough to hold my own in a conversation. It's real awkward when someone you don't know well mentions something like ""Omg Alabama beat blah blah Oregon blah blah [insert athlete name you've never heard of] blah"" and all I can do is nod my head in blissful ignorance. 

Up till now I haven't given a fuck. Why keep up with sports if I don't care about it? But I've realized that just about every single man (at least at my school) keeps up with it. If you're being introduced to someone, even if you have absolutely nothing in common, you can usually still bond over sports because nearly everyone pays attention to it. Some of you are probably thinking ""ok, so what?"" For a lot of you, it probably doesn't matter. But it could potentially be really helpful for networking and meeting new people. The benefit of having good relationships isn't to win some bullshit high school popularity contest, it's that you'll get opportunities that you normally wouldn't like getting the hookup to jobs. I can remember numerous occasions where I've dined with adults who could've gotten me a job at their company and they've started talking about sports. Having the sports knowledge would've definitely come in handy then.

Anyways, I'm just wondering how many people keep up to date with sports only so that they can ""hold their own"" when the conversation topic switches to sports. I don't currently do this, but it would definitely benefit my life if I did.

264934,"Atheists generally have strong logical skills.  They are good at comparing religious doctrines against one another, finding holes and irregularities where they may exist.  They are also good at rejecting scientific claims that certain religions may make that directly contradict actual scientific evidence (e.g. that the Earth was created several thousand years ago).

By far, the most common atheist argument I hear is that there is no empirically verifiable evidence for the existence of God.  If there were some such evidence, atheists would convert; since there is not, they might as well believe in the Flying Spaghetti Monster or unicorns.

So, what I don't understand is how these atheists get away with not acknowledging that God, as He/She exists today, is a metaphysical entity, not a physical one.  As such, God's existence is *inherently* unable to be proven with physical evidence.  The question of God's existence, like other [metaphysical questions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphysics#Central_questions), *cannot be known with certainty*.  

Regarding metaphysical entities, one could either remain agnostic (e.g. ""I cannot know with certainty whether there is X, and I choose not to make a guess""), or one could take a stance one way or the other based on whichever makes most sense (again, not basing the judgment on presence or lack of evidence, since this is irrelevant for metaphysical entities).  So rejecting the existence of a metaphysical entity like God based on a lack of physical evidence is a *completely worthless* argument.

Am I missing something?  Why do atheists, who are generally otherwise intelligent and logical, miss this crucial argument?  Or do they know about it and choose to ignore it?

**TL;DR** God, as He/She exists today, is posited to be a metaphysical entity, so why do atheists constantly ask for physical evidence of God's existence?  [Metaphysical questions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphysics#Central_questions) cannot be answered with physical evidence.

**Edit 1:** Three commonly raised counterarguments, with my answers here for convenience:

* (1) If God (or any metaphysical entity) intervenes in the physical world (as Christians believe God does), then shouldn't these physical interventions be able to provide evidence of God's existence? 

*Response:* Metaphysical entities can have manifestations in the physical world. But that does not necessarily mean that the scientific method can be used to gather evidence regarding the entities' existence or non-existence.

If the metaphysical intervention leaves behind a [physically verifiable relic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miracle_of_Lanciano), the intervention of a metaphysical entity could be verified by science.

If not (as is the case with most alleged cases of metaphysical intervention, such as answering a prayer or affecting a temporary event), the science will be useless in evaluating the metaphysical entity.  Science works due to the ability to repeat physical experiments and achieve the same results. The source of the repeatability of scientific experiments is the physical laws that govern the action of physical entities. Metaphysical entities, by definition, are not constrained by physical laws, so they cannot be evaluated by the scientific method.  You cannot put a metaphysical entity ""to the test"" in the physical world, so you cannot evaluate it using physical evidence.

* (2) While there is no direct evidence against the existence of God, there is direct evidence against some things in the Bible, like God creating the Earth a couple thousand years ago.

*Response:*  Disproving a literal interpretation of something in the Bible does not disprove the existence of God, or even the existence of a God which inspired the Bible.  I am Catholic; in official doctrines, we accept evolution, reject young-earth Creationism, accept a heliocentric universe, etc.  Sometimes it takes us a little while, but we do not reject any scientifically proven facts.

* (3) OK, but why the Christian God and not some other metaphysical entity? 

*Response:*  This whole post is a counter-argument to the frequent atheist demand for physical evidence of God's existence.  This question falls outside the scope of what this counter-argument addresses.  There are other arguments available to address this question, but in the interest of keeping this focused let's save that debate for another day.

I am a transgendered male to female. I have had a very long life with probably a bit more difficult than I deserved. Something I can admit now.
I currently am 23 years old. I live in Minnesota. I have felt like a girl all of my life, although I have hidden this from everybody around me except a few online until January 17th of 2010.

On that date, after losing 80 lbs, and making my first therapy appointment I told my mother. She did not react well, I predicted this. I live at home, I have since just before I was 20. I escaped my home schooled, ultra conservative home when I was 19, after saving enough to purchase my own car, my own insurance, and saving up enough to move out of state. 30 days before this move, I was in a car accident which left me with a disgenerating injury which got worse over time. I was unemployed by one day at the time of the accident, leaving me no disability option. After moving and the injury getting worse I was forced to quit my employment (IT work, mostly cabling in Atlanta,) and move home.

I have lived an abusive life with my family at home. My step-brother committed suicide when he was 16. I was 4 at the time. I have a sister whom was 13 at the time of his death. My family for a good 5 years after his death and my father to this day was very abusive. Physically and emotionally. My mother used to hit me every time I did anything other than sit in a corner and read books (I read Lord of the Rings, the Hobbit, and the Silmarilion by the time I was 7 because of this.) My father forced me to play baseball with him as the coach in a local summer league. The level of his abuse can be summed up in two short cases. One time I was biking with him, I was 7. I slid on newly paved gravel and wiped out, breaking my leg, 10 blocks from home. Because I cried he made me walk home. When I was 10, our baseball team took first place in our league, one game before the final in playoffs, I had a line drive strike my hand and shatter two fingers. Because I couldn't play my father kicked me off the team. I did not get a trophy, or in the team picture.

I was beaten regularly by neighborhood kids when I was 6-18 for being homeschooled (I never have been inside of a school, save for a college, for my G.E.D, once.) They did things as a group so it was always 6 on 1. Things they did later on as a teenager... I had my hands zip tied behind my back after they knocked me out and was thrown into a river as is. I was knocked out and woke up with someone choking me to the point repeatedly of passing out, it didn't stop until I agreed to eat different feces of various animals, cats, dog, rabbit.

In the last two years I have lost 160 lbs, the following is a comparison as me as a boy: http://i.imgur.com/aOtv0.jpg

 The first clinic I started therapy for being transgendered at was a murder. I was 22 at the time and in order to start hormones they claimed I needed to have consent forms signed by my mother, father, and my drunkard sister whom used to drag guys home and chase me out of my bed with a baseball bat, and proceed to have sex in it. My parents know this, my mother whom is the only one who knows of my transgenderism supports her, over me.

The following are comparison pictures for all:

After a brief set back with the economic downturn, it happened. I'm doing something I fucking love- writing and performing. And people have appreciated my work, to the point that I've started getting amazing assignments- stuff that I could only dream of doing a couple of years ago. 

The problem now is- I suck.
I've submitted scripts that have come back with comments like ""just about all right."" ""Potential, but still needs a lot of work."" This is after I've slaved and fretted and fumed over something for hours.

This is totally affecting any semblance of self-esteem I had because I'm suddenly fuckall. Just general overall fuckall. And because of that, I can't seem to write. So yay, vicious circle.

I'm afraid that I'm just not worth anything. Since I don't seem to have any identity outside of work, I feel like nothing right now.

I'm scared as hell. I want this. I want to be good. I want to do it because I love it but it scares the shit out of me.

I don't want to start hating it. I want to be good at it. I want to make something of myself.

Every time I sit down in front of a blank document, my first thought is ""OK, don't fuck this one up."" It pretty much goes downhill from there because the anxiety kicks in.

What the fuck am I doing? I know I have it in me. If I don't then I swear on everything that is holy that I will try so freaking hard that it will come to me. I'm NOT GIVING UP. Right now though, I'm just scared shitless.

I remember watching the Truman Show when I was in Junior High, and thinking, that it seemed exactly like this to me. Everyday seemed as if everyone was in on this joke, and I was part of some sort of experiment. 

In high school, I experimented with a lot of hallucinogenic drugs, but I was lucky to be friends with the kids who would almost take these drugs as a sacrament, and tried to learn something from the experiences. It further solidified my notion.

As I grew up, went to school, learned science, and contemplated this idea through another perspective, it has never left me. I got married, live a completely normal life (sort of mundane actually), but can't shake the thought that my wife and family were created to teach me something in some sort of holographic virtual universe-simulator. The more I learned from science, the more I realized how it would be possible to fabricate an alternate reality such as the one I was experiencing.

266370,"I usually only browse, and have seen that this subreddit is very quiet about a significant portion of our population. Here are some provocative points about Muslims in India:

* India is a big country. But despite this huge size, there is something that binds Indians - Muslims have problems everywhere. If there are [Muslims in Ladakh](http://english.pravda.ru/news/world/10-02-2006/75745-india-0/), they have trouble with Buddhists. Muslims in [Kerala](http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/pdfid/4b6fe2482.pdf), at the other end of the nation, will have trouble with Christians.  Hyderabadi Muslims have constant friction with Andhrites, historically as well as in the present day ( one of the most constant sights is riot police near Charminar and other areas of old city). 

    Apart from external threats, what binds India is the trouble its non-Muslims have with Muslims. Parties like BJP and others ignore this at their own peril. A thriving and ghettoized Muslim community is a important part of a united India. All we need is more riot police. 

* Indian Muslims use ""Muslim"" names. Except they forget to tell you that there is no dictionary of Muslims names that comes as appendix A to the Koran. Indian Muslims just like to use Arab names to differentiate themselves from the rest of the Indians. Arundhati (Ray) is a Syrian Christian, but her parents did not name her Elizabeth, or any ""Christian"" name. They named her after the language of her parents, which was Malayalam or Sanskrit. Ok, people like Salman Khan may have Turkic heritage, so he is a Khan - makes sense. But 80-90% of Indian muslims are not Arabs or Turks, they are like anyone else. But they insist on calling their kids Arab/Turkic names.

    India lost a lot of wars from muslims invaders; no wonder people want to follow the example of the the winning team rather than the losing team.    

* The Sachar Committie report. Lets see - you have population growing at 40-50% faster than the rest of the population, and you expect your average income of Muslims to keep up with the rest of the population? What the hell are these people smoking? Do they know what average means? If Muslims have more kids than the other people, and if they grow at the same rate, their average wealth and income WILL lessen. 
 
    The recommendations of the Sachar committie mean nothing more than the fact that the rest of the nation will subsidize each third kid  from a Muslim family. You know, that little Akbar? You will pay for his upkeep. If you do not, be prepared for more rioting ( isn't that the reason Muslims are getting special reports? Otherwise Biharis are poorer. Even your average UP'ite is poorer than the average Indian Muslim).

* Does anyone know from where did the movement of Pakistan get its maximum support in the 1930s and 1940s? In present day Bihar, UP and other such parts of present day India. Your average Muslim politician in UP, in those decade was a leader of the Muslim league, and wanted separate electorate, and when that did not satisfy them, a separate nation. 

    Thats history. How it affects us today is how these guys then asked for separate civil code, at the threat of more violence, and got it. Nehru, Ambedkar et al had no other option. 

    A common law is a necessity of a nation - as long as we don't have same laws, we are not a nation. Personally, I have no loyalty to this make-believe ""nation"", and I advise you too desist from false patriotism. Save as much taxes as you can, of those who are not wage slaves. Wage slaves are fucked anyway - but you can help others by not insisting on a bill, so they save on some VAT. 

* Guess the only state with Muslim majority in India. now guess the only state where people and leaders have shown a preference to get out of India for the last 50 years. Its the same state - or more correctly the region of Kashmir. (Personally I believe they should be allowed to go out - why insist on keeping them with us? To further the sense of false nationhood? Suckers believe that Kashmir is integral to India. It is not).

**Possible premise**: All planets in the Alpha quadrant have now been united.  Ties of commerce and transportation link them but the neighboring quadrants are unstable. In addition scientists on Earth have just discovered a way to travel between (parallel universes/alternate dimensions, whatever) which opens the door to new enemies and unexplored territory that could threaten the quadrant.

266825,"this past summer break i was hanging out by myself and had been for awhile thinking a lot about Christianity and God, ect. at this point I no longer viewed the Christian religion as a force of good in the world and rejected its legitimacy. However, the first time that I truly considered the notion of a world without God, no heaven or hell, and everything that goes along with it really fucking freaked me out. I had already been feeling pretty depressed about various things that summer (shitty boring job, most of my friends went home for summer break, ect) but this just fucking did me in. I was simply pondering the subject when something in my own reasoning just kinda clicked and all of a sudden my mind started racing and I was coming to all of these horrible conclusions about death and stuff. Then I started having tunnel vision and things got really bad. I got really confused and all of my arm and leg muscles became very tense. I thought i was going to die. All I could think about was that I going insane and everything I used to believe in was crumbling before me. To keep myself from passing out I made my way to my bedroom and laid on my bed with my head between my legs, rocking back and forth for about 4 or 5 hrs until I finally fell asleep from exhaustion. I woke up a few hours later with a really bad hangover type feeling. I was extremely embarrassed about the whole thing and for months didn't tell anybody what had happened. I though I had had a nervous breakdown and tried to forget that it ever occurred. Eventually I looked up 'panic attack' on Wikipedia and found out that heavy stress can trigger a release of adrenaline from the glands in your back, which can lead to a panic attack. I had no previous history of severe anxiety but this had apparently put me over the edge. Scary fucking way to come to that sort of realization after being brought up in a traditional Christian household my entire life.

Free Will - The power of acting without the constraint of **fate**

Omniscience - Knowing everything.

So, let's presume there exists a being with free will and there exists a being with omniscience. The free willed being will make choices; the omniscient being knows what the free willed being will choose before said being can make said choices.

268012,"Let me break it down for you, using cold hard logic.

The theories of determinism and indeterminism are opposites. The first theory says that everything that happens in a system (i.e., the universe) is determined by the prior state of that system. The theory of indeterminism states that what happens in a system is *not* determined beforehand.

Simply put, determinism thinks that every event in a system (including human actions) is determined by the prior state of said system, just as simply as a ball rolling down a hill. Indeterminism thinks that these events are not completely determined by the prior state of the system; that there is more than one possible outcome in a system.

By the very nature of these two theories, one **must** be true, and the other **must** be false.

If determinism is true, then all of our actions have been determined beforehand. Therefore, we cannot be credited with making our own choices, as the choices we make were predetermined for us; therefore, we have no free will.

If indeterminism is true, then we make our choices at random. If we make our choices at random, then we are unable to ever truly control ourselves. Therefore, we have no free will.

How do you build the mental fortitude it takes to rid the world of such a wretched life? I have failed in the past and I cannot live through another mistake.

About 30 minutes later, he pulls up, I realize he's an old as shit man, who looks more like a mummy than a person. We continue to go on a test drive, and it's surprisingly normal. On the way back, we pull into the mcdonalds parking lot adjacent to my work's parking lot. He said, do you mind if I go through the drive thru, and I said sure. He asks me if I wanted anything, and I said no. We continue to order and says ""I'm going to have a strawberry milkshake, ad this cute little boy is going to have an ice cream cone"" From that moment on I was speechless. As soon as we got to the window I grab the cone out of his hand, hurl it across the parking lot, go ""fuck this"", grab the steering wheel out of this hand, drive back to the work parking lot. The old man scrambles out of the car into his truck and drives off.

I haven't flossed for *years*, yet my teeth and gums are in fine condition according to my dentist - better condition, in fact, than my mother's and sister's who obsess over dental care.  I didn't floss through braces (2.5 years) or after (2 years and counting), and flossed very sparingly before that.  I have very few cavities, and don't have bad breath.  Every six months, it's the same deal: I tell my dentist that I floss a couple times each week, and he tells me to floss more in an ""I'm obliged to do this"" tone.

So, Reddit, is flossing really as critical to dental hygiene as it's made out to be?  How so or how not?  Thanks.",-1,-1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
268749,"I've always viewed suicide as something someone does when they aren't serious about doing it and just want attention. I'm starting to understand though that it comes in phases, and I'm really feeling at times like I don't want to be here anymore.

I went to school for six years for a four year degree. I kept changing majors thinking like every ignorant college student does ""Oh, companies are gonna want me the moment I graduate"". During this time I made poor decision, racked up credit card debt, bought a motorcycle, etc.

When I graduated, I realized that getting a job wasn't easy. I'm currently working the same job I did in high school making just a little more than I was then. As I began to fall behind in payments on everything, I took out loans from my parents. As I tried to make payments on those, I started falling behind again, and now my interest rates are outrageous.

If I keep making minimum payments, I'll never get out on top. I feel like I'm fighting a losing battle here and I'm beginning to question why bother. I'm also lonely and I have no money to go out and do anything for the sake of being responsible.

Currently I'm about $40,000 in debt, with 30% interest on about 10,000 of that. The other $30,000 is student loans. I don't want to screw my parents over so I'm trying to pay back their loans. I live alone and I'm cold because I'm missing a wall (been working on repairing a crappy single wide trailer, don't have to pay rent on this place). Also, my crappy little job has started cutting my hours so I'm getting even LESS money, but every job I've applied for has said I'm either underqualified or overqualified. I've got several computer certifications and I graduated at the top of my program in college, I don't understand why things are so hard. 

To top it off, every time I start feeling bad for myself, I get guilty because I realize there are people with far worse situations with mine and that makes me feel worse.

TLDR; I'm depressed. I have enormous debt with seemingly no way out. I've applied for close to 100 jobs in the past 5 months and I'm tired of being rejected.

Something bad was happening as a result of them using it so much, maybe? They had to lay in a see-through box-coffin type thing, I believe it was also supplied with a limited amount of oxygen, so they needed O2 tanks.

He's the type that has lived by the rules all his life, then something happens and he's just had enough, decides to get revenge.

I want to try and hook back up with my ex girlfriend. It wasn't a bad break up and I was told it was becuase we never spent enough time together. She was right, if we saw each other twice in one week it was a good week. 
I can still remember the last night we spent together. I went home to go to bed (yeah, I'm an idiot). I remember the way she said ""your leaving?"" and now that I look back on it I can tell she was hurt and frustrated from her tone. I'd be willing to bet that she decided then that our relationship wasn't working out. Two days later she dumped me.

It's been a while since then and we're both single. I want to try and date her again but I'm not sure how to go about doing this. I'm a very straight forward person and my idea would be just to show up at her place and ask her on a date, but I was hopping for a little advice on not how to blindside her.

Not a crazy amount, but I was drunk and had no intention of doing something as hard as measuring. Probably 1/4 or so of a bottle, but probably less. 

I went to sleep and woke up a couple of hours later. I felt kind of strange. Like I was dreaming but awake. I was completely conscious and knew something was up, but if I closed my eyes I kind of got really sidetracked and would have to open my eyes again to make sure I was where I thought I was. I half-slept for about 4-5 more hours until I felt fine enough to interact with the outside world. 

I was able to function fine but felt a little ""fuzzy."" As if there was a small disconnect between my senses and my emotions. Over the past two days I've felt better but still slightly off. I've been interacting with my family, in public, etc. So I'm not freaking out or anything but I'm a little worried as to when I'll feel 100% again. I occasionally have little worrying spells of whether or not I'll ever feel right again. The best way I can describe it is that I feel slightly third person, as if I'm not completely IN a situation, more like I'm responding to it. 

Anyone else have an experience like this? Just wait it out and I'll be fine? Is there a vitamin or something I should take? I'm a little tired and slightly nauseous. Again, nothing horrible, but I'm paranoid about stuff like this.

271178,"Share some if you have some. They don't necessarily have to be love stories. A date, friendship, relationship, marriage, anything. It's sad, but it happens and I wanna hear people's stories and how they dealt with it.

**My story:**

I met this guy a few years back, let's say his name was John. John was a few years older than me and very intelligent. He had a stable job, amazing conversations, we laughed at everything and had a good time. He was a really shy guy at first, but that quickly changed the more we got to know eachother.

I was still a bit immature and he was very inexperienced with relationships and girls, so instead of talking about our feelings freely it was very passive aggressive but cute non the less. John was really quiet, but the time we spent talking was never awkward. I loved seeing him, I loved how shy he was on the phone, I loved the good morning texts and sweet dream ones. We were too young to be thinking about anything serious, so it was pretty much just puppy love.

John sometimes would tell me he had to go places, or couldn't talk right now. Every time I asked him where, he would make a joke out of it, change the subject and just assure me that it was a thing with family. (I knew he wasn't cheating because he really did go with his family.) I was too young and infatuated to worry or be scared of where he was going. 

The first time we broke up was after about a year, because he was unsure about us. When I wanted to talk to him, he'd tell me I was too clingy. When I didn't, he'd beg for me to talk to him. When I was acting affectionate, he's be distant. When I was distant he'd beg for my affection. I couldn't put up with it and I decided it was better to stop talking.

After a few months we decided to give it another try. But this time something was very different. He was a lot colder and a lot meaner. At first, it was little things. Asking me why I was atheist. Asking me what proof I had. Telling me I was wrong.

Then it started to get more serious. He told me while we stopped talking he looked seriously into his religion. He's a Jehovah's witness and never took it seriously before. All those places he went that he wouldn't tell me about? It was his family dragging him to church.

It would be fight, after fight. Religion didn't matter to me. I didn't bring it up. He would get more horrible and more scary. On the phone at night instead of talking and laughing together again he'd try to read me passages from the Bible. If I didn't want to hear it, he'd say I didn't care about his beliefs. He'd tell me how when he went to church and saw the ""happy couples"" praying he'd feel like crying because he knew he couldn't have that with me. It eventually escalated to him crying, crying about how we couldn't be together forever because I'd be going to Hell. Instead of cute notes or emails, it was things about God. I didn't want to hear it, and I told him. Eventually he brought the conversation about marriage, and said how he couldn't ever marry somebody who doesn't share his belief and his kids were going to be raised that way too.

That was the last straw for me. He was just trying to change me, and I wasn't going to change. I asked him ""So you would never marry me how I am right now? You're just waiting for me to change?"" and he said yes.

After that it was tears and tears. Memories of us being happy. Memories about our relationship before religion came into it. Our time spent together, our amazing conversations, how we agreed and disagreed on things, how nice and understanding he was. When he started taking religion seriously, that all went away. :/

**PS:** I realize this may be a little on the extreme side but.. just make sure if you ever date somebody religions they're content with you being atheist FOREVER. Not just waiting for you to ""grow out of it"" or convert. And not want to force religion into your life knowing you don't believe.",1,-1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
271179,"My friend has a Shiba Inu that's around two years old. It's coat is healthy, and besides being something of a bitch to dogs coming into the household, her behavior is normal. 

The poor dog hates pooping. I can't blame her-she screams in pain every time she has to, and then spends the next few hours periodically licking her butt to try and make it better. My friend has her on mineral oil daily to try and help but the dog still is in pain every time she has a movement.

Besides this, her gums are receding. Remember, two year old dog, whose owner brushes her teeth daily. The gums on the bottom are so gone that she's having to get the dog's teeth pulled next week, and could wiggle the teeth around a little when she showed me.

The only other symptom is that her nails are brittle.

Anything? She's been to three or four vets already, working on number five, and none of them had even the slightest idea what was wrong. She's a vet tech, too, and has never seen anything like it. We suspect it's something systemic, and probably isn't environmental, as they just moved from WI to AK and are in an entirely different setting from previously, with no improvement.

So, I had mutually appreciated music playing, some plant matter to consume as we are wont to do, and a comfortable spot for things to get intimate, should they take that course. My question concerns events immediately after she arrived and the rest of the time we spent together. 

We hugged when I first opened the door, shared a little small talk on the way down the stairs, and then I went to the sink to get a glass of water. As far as I can tell, it was at this point about 30 seconds in when she stood the closest to me, looked at me right, and just generally seemed... Anticipatory. It came on so fast that I think this may have been the point I missed my chance.

The rest of the afternoon went well, smoking, going through music, just sort of catching up. After about an hour I'd started to lose hope, but eventually the music got turned off entirely, and we were just sitting, facing each other, talking, and I started to twist my hair, just to do something with my hands... And she did the same, until I stopped, which she did too. As I understand, this is a fairly good indication of interest. I wanted to tell her how I had missed her and make my move, but... It just felt like the 'tone' was wrong. This too, may have been my mistake. I'm really not sure.

My question is essentially did I blow it in the first minute because I was caught off guard, or did I miss an obvious opportunity later on because I psyched myself out?

272432," Welcome to the city of Reddit. It didn't always use to be like this...
 Wow, where to start...Well I have been coming to Reddit City for 2 and a half years now but I didn't actually get an apartment here until  7 months ago. No, come to think of it, the first time was more like 3 years ago. 

 I was really into the club scene back then and mostly lived in Youtube. I hated MySpace City because of the vibe it gave off but I do admit driving though now and then to pick up some hotties. (Oh, and there was my rebellious stage when I would hang out in gangland  4chan..but I would rather just forget that time of my life...)

 Though Youtube I found the city of Digg and got a house there. It was boom time in Digg but I hated the public transportation. There was like only 5 or 6 stations!! I mean, unless you like to ride the local trains, every stop was Cracked, Gizmodo, 10 ten lists....oh god the lists... Look, if I like Star Wars then 'Top ten things you have never heard about Star Wars' is probably already know to me (not to mention such a pretenctious title)... And if I don't like Star Wars then why would I read it anyway!?! Sorry sorry..commuting there got to be a bitch..

 It was way back then that I first drove though Reddit. Truthfully, I didn't think much of it. The buildings were sort of..well..drab and dreary.. I mean Digg was all shiny and razzle dazzle while Reddit just seemed so stoic and lifeless. I have hear that London and Moscow are like that... The outside is all rainy and drab, or snowy and monotone, but when you see the inside, there is light and laughter and happiness. 

 Reddit at that time was only a small town. It had an intellectual and  liberal feel to it that I desperately needed at the time. Philosophers and mathematicians and engineers gathered to discuss and debate. Politics, religion, sex... all the taboo subjects that would get you in a flame war anywhere else on the map was discussed about as adults!
It was amazing.

 Then the city counsel of Digg forclosed on my little apartment there. To this day I still don't know why. But just one day I show up and there is a note on the door saying 'you're out'. I was flustered to say the least. But by that time I was spending half of my time here anyway so a painful move it was not.. Although I did miss all my stuff... I mean, you work hard to set down roots, make a reputation for yourself in the neighborhood...then BAM..the hammer hits you out of nowhere..

 I still had my studio apartment in Youtube and a bunch of friends there, but I wanted something more..I wanted what you just could just not find in the world of the web. An adultlike responsibility to ones actions, be it homeowner or city councelman (yeah, I'm talking to you Digg)..lol

 Where was I (you should not let grandpa ramble on like that...) oh, yes, small town Reddit. What do I remember most about it? Ron Paul. lol. Seriously though, politics was big. I never looked at American politics, thought about the issues, and studied the big picture like I did on Reddit. And religion!! I thought I was alone in my nonbelief. I found like minded freethinkers. I loved every minute of it.

 But then (dun dun dunnnn) the big corporations got in too deep with the mayor of Digg, and the people striked. Chaos in the streets, dogs and cats..living together..you know the rest.. Factories closed, jobs were lost.. And people by the thousands moved out of Digg and into Reddit. Population here exploded.

 Even before Digg went bust, Reddit was becoming an international port. Mostly European immigrants, with a smattering of Asian people bringing new ideas and culture. And Reddit for the most part welcomes all newcomers..well almost all..

 Lately you hear more and more complaints from the oldtimers. And more and more people are moving to the subreddits. They don't like what mainstreet has become. And they have a point. With in any 100 people you have the chance of 1 or 2 trolls. Make that a 1000 and you get 10 or 20, but now that the City of Reddit is in the millions..

 Well crime is definately up. You got your beggers, your scam artists, bullies, and carpetbaggers...all making the trusting more jaded day by day. The councilmen of Reddit do what they can, and neighborhood watches have always been good here, but many have a sinking feeling that hard times are coming...that we have grown too big, too fast..

 To them I say, look around! Don't lose you sense of hope. We have something awesome here. Yes it is big, and scary, and at times smells like urine (looking at you WTF), but god damn it, this is a great city! An international cultural smorgasbord of delights. 24 hours a day, a true city that never sleeps! Sure we have more people, but think about it! Now we have more lovelies and hunks to find their inner-star in the redlight district of gonewild and nsfw. We have more thoughts coming in world wide to break us out of our hivemind set! As the city grows so does our influence in real life! (Hey Mr. Colbert, How are the holidays treating you?) And everyday I learn something new. Hivemind or no...I love being here...now...in Reddit

Text to save you guys a click on the above:)

Years ago I saw what I think was webcomic that appeared to have just started, and I'd really like to dig it up again. I only remember two, both making light of ADHD. The strips went something like this:

(**SPOILER ALERT** by the way, in case it is found and people want to read the comics.)

* First panel shows a stand-up comedian on stage saying ""I have ADHD, and it's *bad*!"" (or similar)
* Second one shows the audience going ""how bad??"", thinking there's a joke coming.
* Last panel shows the stand-up comedian intensely occupied with playing Game Boy.

The second strip (very next one, I think) shows a guy reading the first strip and becoming outraged because he has ADHD as well. He starts to draft a letter to the webcomic author about it, but then the last panel he is searching for bunnies on Google image search, having forgotten whatever he was doing...

I thought they encapsulated ADD/ADHD incredibly well, and I'd like to find them again, but I have literally Googled for hours and I can't find them. I don't remember anything else from the webcomic, or even if it was a steady webcomic (and not just a couple of cute strips someone made), or names, etc. It was colors and nicely drawn though. So I'm praying someone here have seen these and knows what I'm talking about.

272950,"I was wondering if drugs are ever used to try to correlate brain anatomy with function. Specifically, I was curious about ""ego death."" This is the phenomenon where an individual no longer thinks in terms of self and non-self. It's usually described as being ""one with the universe.""

The state can be induced with large doses of LSD-like substances, or moderate doses of salvinorin A. It can also be obtained spontaneously, through meditation, or some combination of drug and thinking (like a large amount of marijuana, with meditation.) However, a lot of LSD, or Salv.A are sure-fire methods. Ego death is different than a dissociative state (which Salv. A can also induce), where the individual feels a disconnect with their body.

Here's a state that can easily be induced and recognized, and is immensely different than normal experience. In other words, you can temporarily eliminate a pillar of folk psychology in someone.

So has anyone taken these variables and made experiments to try to illuminate the mechanisms underlying ego death? Even just at the abstract level? I'm not suggesting that these experiments will reveal a structure like Descarte's idea of the pituitary gland, or some other cogsci panacea.

Or, here's another question I'm not sure anyone's attempted to answer: why do deliriants produce true hallucinations? The vast majority of psychedelic visuals aren't true hallucinations, since the user can tell that serpents on the floor aren't real (even if it's unsettling). Hallucinations from deliriants (datura, Diphenhydramine, etc.) are indistinguishable from reality until they vanish. The delirious person will have conversations with people who aren't there, smoke invisible cigarettes, and more. It's not surprising that anticholinergic drugs would have a wide range of effects, but consistently creating phantasms? Why?

I'm positive fruitful research would come from trying to answer these questions using whatever is at cognitive scientists' disposal.


So why aren't these tools being used (or, why can't I find it with google scholar)? There are dozens of psychedelics with subtly different, yet consistent effects (in the right setting).

272974,"I've seen a few people suggest thetiebar.com as a website to shop at for ties and tie clips. I spent some money that was gifted at christmas on a large order. I got [two silk neck ties, a knit tie, a bow tie, and the 1-inch tie bar](http://i.imgur.com/fkWJT.jpg) from them. I thought I'd make a post about their finer and less fine points.

The neck ties and the bow tie are solidly made. They're reinforced inside and the thickness is comparable to that of a tie from J. Crew or Express. For a 15 dollars each, the two silk neck ties are a great deal. I can pretty much say the same for the bow tie, except the size clasp seems a bit flimsy. Other than that the stitching and the durability seems just fine.

The knit tie is the one thing I'll be returning for two reasons. A: it's a lot wider than the site let on (3 inches) and it just looks kind of silly for a knit tie to be that wide. B: it feels real flimsy. I have a knit tie from J. Crew and it has a corded rib going down the center that gives it a feeling of real quality, that is not in this one. They did put a bit of reinforcement on the back, which was nice but there's just something lacking in the quality of the business end of it.

The 1-inch tie bar is also of pretty good quality. One thing about it, is that it's incredibly small, but still quite noticable once it's on. It really completes the look of a shirt and tie without being too showy and looks great on a skinny tie. (I wear a lot of skinny ties due to the ill proportionate size of my neck and head.

I am really impressed with the purchase I made. A lot of times when someone says ""I spent 60 dollars on ties"" that means they paid for one tie. If anyone is into knit ties just remember that the quality of the knit is not their strong suit.

273894,"[throwaway account, though I vent on my main account as well] 

I don't even know where to begin, but I guess this is a starting point:

I am so fucking alone. Just ALONE. 

I read all these other ""forever alone"" things, and get really frustrated when they've had at least one girlfriend or sexual experience or something. 

I am a female. I'm in my ""prime"", mid-20s. I'm supposed to be having the time of my life. You know, traveling, career-building, dating, living.

But all the rejection shit from the past and my current state leaves me feeling worthless and rejected. 

And really horny, surprisingly - it just gets WORSE each year. I *always* talk about sex, mostly because  everyone else I know has done it at least once and I'm always getting rejected from the guys I like. No guys have ever liked me in any romantic sense - I can only come to the conclusion that I must be very unattractive or disgusting. Most of my average-looking friends are married or engaged now - not that I want to be THERE, but I want SOME notches under my belt. Without dying, of course. 

I've never figured out what's wrong with me - no one has ever actually commented on my appearance, so I have no idea if I'm ""too ugly"" or something to even have sex with, or whether it's my race (I'm black, and I grew up and live around mostly white people/things - I've tried so hard to connect with my culture and other people like me, but I get rejected there as well for not being ""on the level"" or ""too white"", though I've experienced the same discrimination they have - we're ALL still the same skin color!)

I haven't ever done ANYTHING sexually, not kissing, holding hands, NOTHING. And it is a source of sincerest shame. I'm intelligent, I like a variety of things (music, food - you name it), I have interests and passions and - I think on that level I'm pretty normal.

All the rejection leaves me feeling like NOTHING, like I'm just not even human. Right now, I'm visiting my parent (I lost my mother when I was 14) home, and all I can think about is how much no one wants to see me (I've sent out mass texts and things about hanging out, but everyone is busy with their family or other friends) and how much fail I am for not having any interesting NYE plans. I either always go to church or stay at home with the family and cry about not being out b/c I have no one to be out with. I really just want to go out, party, meet a nice guy and have sex. But I'm sure that if I haven't been able to do that in the 20-someodd years I've been alive, I won't be able to do it now  - or in a way that I don't end up diseased (even with a condom), drugged, pregnant or dead. I'd have to go by myself - no one is EVER there to look out for you. 

I have a terrible time making and keeping friends. I never find anyone that I can become really close to...or they always find other people to become BFFs with and I always get left out in the cold. It's been like that since I can remember (when I was 5, I distinctly remember this). I try to go out, but I don't have transportation during school time, and I'm by myself so a lot of times it isn't safe to be out at night so late...I do it anyway b/c I'm desperate to be social or to prove that I have a LIFE. Even when nobody is there with me - nobody is EVER with me (I've asked, nobody I know likes to do a lot of the things I like to do...nobody does, at least in the capacity to become my friend)

I'm also fat/obese/overweight. I eat right (I do! I'm no ""fat slob"", I don't eat out except MAYBE once every other week with friends, I eat all kinds of fresh veggies, I don't eat beef or pork, I drink more ounces than my weight in water), exercise frequently (to the point of exhaustion) - and I've lost barely ANYTHING, which is so frustrating. Of course, as a fat girl,  nobody cares that you DON'T sit around eating lard and watching TV all day, and can probably run further than they can. All anyone sees is FAT. All I ever see of myself is FAT. Even when I getting a plate of food for a meal, my father is always commenting on how much or how little I'm eating. It's never ""just right"". AND I'M STILL FUCKING FAT. I pinch and pull and pry at everything on my body, and when I find clothes that only JUST are too small, I cry in the store. I've had so many dreams where I've just cut open my stomach and pulled all the fat out...I wish SO BADLY that that would work, without dying. 

I'm always jealous that everyone else can eat ridiculous hamburgers and pizza, not exercise, and not gain an OUNCE. I haven't had any of those things in YEARS (everything I eat is grilled chicken or fish, or vegetarian), mostly because I have a gallstone. BUT STILL I HAVE NOT LOST ANYTHING. 

All I want is weight-loss surgery. It's so expensive, and I just don't have the time. I can't believe I've gotten to a point where I'm willing to take a chance DYING on some operating table just so people will notice me, like me, date me, bang me. 

More than anything, I'm more depressed that I've become so...**desperate**.  When did my self-validation depend on other people? Why do I never feel qualified to say, ""I'm okay"", because no one else thinks I am? Why do I think that the ONLY way I will ever feel better about myself is if other people like me and I were thinner? 

...what the hell am I supposed to do about it that I'm NOT already doing? 

[I am seeing a counselor and psychiatrist to deal with this - though I'm probably going to have to stop very soon because I now have no insurance and as a student, I can't afford $200/hr sessions, and there's no consistent alternative that's cheap enough. I already have a $600 bill I have to pay them for back sessions, with what money, I have no idea. I've been on various antidepressants, but they just make me a zombie and my hair falls out.]

I should also note that if you do use the activex control you get to have all kinds of recording and picture taking features that are built in to the camera software.  I'm not concerned with having those features in other browsers, just the smooth fps.

Chelsea in particular have the issue of an aging first team, but are reluctant to spend big in anticipation of the UEFA financial fair play rules starting to come into effect. Liverpool were forced to buy English, explaining purchases like Shelvey, Joe Cole and Konchesky and also why they paid a ridiculous amount for that (18 year old) Scottish boy.

274986,"So I just started playing LoL about a week ago. I've played DotA on and off for a couple years now, but decided to try LoL out for a bit instead. It wasn't very hard to see the similarities in strategies between LoL and DotA. But a couple things stood out to me. LoL seems a lot more action oriented than DotA, which is slower-paced. LoL seems to be balanced as far as individual heroes go, but not as far as hero genres/niches go. But the biggest difference to me was that items hardly ever have actives, or even passive-actives (things like orb effects or radiance in DotA.) So one game, I was playing as Ashe who I consider the most OP hero I've played so far. I was level 6 (in the ELO rankings, not in the game) i think, and we were losing slightly. The other team had a Kennen who had gone on some streaks but fallen off as the game went on. I told my team to do what I was doing and focus her in battles because she was the only one getting kills or really doing anything... Suddenly we won a team battle, pushed into their base and won... Then in the after-game room the Kennen started talking trash and saying that Ashe is an easy hero (which I don't disagree with) especially because I ended the game 16-4. But my question is this, If there are so many small things you can do in this game that are ""noob"" things to do and make the game easier, can it really be called a strategy game? I'm hoping that as I get higher in levels the strategy aspect of the game will become more important, is this true?

275370,"Hello! I take Lithium for bipolar 1 disorder, and I desperately need it to function normally. A few years ago I was married and trying to get pregnant, so I went off Lithium (under the care of a psychiatrist) and switched to Abilify. 

I only lasted a few weeks before I tried to kill myself, put a dent in the kitchen wall in the shape of my husband, and walked around my neighborhood drinking tequila out of a sippy cup. Then I was back on the Lithium, an adoption fell through, and I ended up having to donate all the baby clothes I bought. Very dark days.

Now I'm divorced and pretty stable. I'm making decent money, and even in a bad economy, I have such strong education and experience that I'm not worried at all. In about a year if all goes well I'll get some job security that comes with a pay bump. I really like being single and independent.

However I'm visiting my sister for the holidays, and she has an adorable little baby. And then I watched the movie Waitress, which has strong baby themes. And I've been thinking about having a baby for years now. It's hard to just turn it off.

I'm 33, but I believe you're safe to have a baby until well after 40, so I have time. I don't want a baby right at this moment, but a couple years from now, I think I'll be considering it again. I'm definitely never getting married again, but having two parents is so 80s. And I could easily get one of my FWBs to father a child while agreeing to a legal arrangement where he pays nothing and in exchange limited custody rights. (I would have a lawyer of course. And by limited custody I mean I would be fine with visitation and stuff but wouldn't want to deal with things like moving restrictions.) I have one FWB who already told me he's looking for such an arrangement.

When I was trying to get pregnant a few years ago I asked my OBGYN about Lithium, and she didn't know about negative effects and said she'd have to look it up. A past psychiatrist said it was horrible and the baby would definitely have birth defects. My current psychiatrist just said it was risky, but she says the same thing about drinking too much coffee.

Of course pharmaceutical companies and doctors are going to cover their asses by saying there's a risk, so don't do it. But none of the doctors can explain to me exactly what the risk is. WebMD says ""This drug is not recommended for use during pregnancy because of possible harm to an unborn baby (e.g., heart problems, other birth defects)."" That's a bit vague.

And I'm not worried about being unable to take care of a child because I'm bipolar. Medicated I'm the most together person I know and people don't believe I'm bipolar when I tell them. 

So what's the risk? If it's something like a 10% chance the baby will die in utero or be stillborn, I'll take that risk. I really can't function without Lithium. That's not an option. 

I'm still open to adoption, especially since I went through the whole long process while married, and I'm super protective about the integrity of my vagina :)

Any thoughts would be helpful. Thank you.

275896,"Hi /r/starcraft,

I am slightly red/green colorblind. I can see both colors mostly fine, but I have trouble seeing the difference when placing buildings. Especially on maps with a grass/green ground. When trying to properly wall off in the beginning this usually forces me to pretty much random-click and hope I didn't leave a hole where units may pass through.

The more and more I play the game I start to just *know* where to place the buildings. But it's a slow learning process. Some other games have options to resolve this problem. BFBC2 has a ""color blind"" option. So does Peggle. Even ET:Quake Wars allows you to change the colors how enemies/friends are shown. I haven't found anything similar yet in SC2.

It drives me insanely sad that developers don't allow for such a basic customization. Given that there is a such high percentage of colorblind people. Heck, it's a pretty fundamental rule in any user-interface (and even arbitrary presentation) design, to not solely rely on colors to convey information.

Has anyone else got similar problems? If yes, did you find a satisfactory solution?

276481,"Hey guys, recently I was looking around the interwebs for a simple script that contained a bunch of basic string manipulation functions (and other assorted things which would be useful every day).

The PrototypeJS library has a massive collection of things like this (I used to use it a lot), however I didn't want to resort to using it since it would just add a lot of bloat that I don't need with its DOM functions, and I'm already using jQuery in most of my projects.

So, having not found what I was looking for, I decided to put together my own.  Currently it includes some basic string manipulation and validation methods, and the magnificent QuirksMode cookie functions.

So I was probably like you and kept looking around and reading up on this Amnesia: The Dark Descent game and heard it was the scariest game ever made. Well me being the pussy I am I wanted to learn as much as I could before I got into it. So I watched reaction video after reaction video and I looked at some game play and so on. 

Watching some footage of Amnesia is perfect, too much and you will become accustomed to it. I even watched some of those playthrough videos every now and then and killed some of the vital scares for me.

The main reason why Amnesia is so scary is the Immersion. I know it has been said every time Amnesia has been brought up but it is true! Play this game with Headphones, and in a Dark room! I played this game with headphones for most of it but the beginning sometimes I took them off. This killed all the sound and immersion from the beginning. Also, don't play while drunk, you will become cocky and not care and that is the opposite of what you want. 

I have beaten the game and by the end it was a cake walk for me. I didn't treat it like an experience, more a game I had to beat to say I beat it. THIS IS NOT ONE OF THOSE GAMES. I did everything I could just to beat the scary game it stopped being scary for me, and now there is no going back.

*Original Post:*
I keep my Droid (Milestone) in my pocket pretty much most of the day.  While listening to music the last few months, it would automatically pause when there was a ""large"" movement like sitting down or standing up.  More recently, it would automatically pause by the time I got it in my pocket so I had to carry it if I wanted to listen to music through the headphones.  After a bit of googling, I came across [this link](http://androidforums.com/motorola-droid/139325-3-5mm-jack-my-droid-total-crap.html#post1303454) which suggests spraying a bit of WD-40 in the headphone jack.  With nothing to lose, I gave it a shot.  The WD-40 seemed to come out pretty fast from the can, so I sprayed it in a separate container and then used a dropper to put about 3 drops in the headphone jack.  I plugged in my headphones and wiggled them around a bit and now everything's perfect.  I don't know if the headphone jack had just accumulated lint from my pocket preventing good contact with the headphones, but it was definitely a nuisance.

We have amazing sex, its never a problem for us in the bed, 
but when she is not around, like right now being in another country while im here for work for about 2 months more, i get too horny during the day that goes by and end up watching porn to release my ""tension"". 

I still find my girlfriend to be the sexiest woman in my eyes, and just having her smile at me can turn me crazy, but when shes not around i feel this build of of tension inside, even if its only 2 days since we had sex. i feel like maybe i shouldn't masturbate to be faithful to my girlfriend in some weird way, or that being like this is the beginning of porn addiction ?

Ive now got a 180gb folder full of porn movies on my laptop, for me the browsing of porn and choosing the movies clips i want to see is more exiting than actually watching some of the movies, but doing this makes me feel like im buying prostitution or something im degrading these women down to properties, like a item just for pleasure and move on, i know it is the definition of porn, but i feel sometimes bad of doing it.  

When it comes to the porn itself, i never like the kind of porn that degrades females into the so called ""cum buckets"", i don't like the fisting, facial, gag and abuse rape play kind of stuff, i like the porn that has beautiful girls with beautiful faces and bodies just having sexual positions and clothes/poses. But every time i watch these porn clips/movies i always imagine doing the positions to my grilfriend, having my girl wear the clothes or be in the positions etc.

But again i feel like am i becoming addicted to it, i can easily delete it , but saying i wont re download new clips in the future, is a lie because i know i would have to masturbate again, but the thought of wanting to masturbate again only two days after being with my girl having amazing sex is what confuses me. i like to watch the movies but after i do my business i turn them off and go back to doing regular stuff.

I don't know i feel weird feelings like this, anyone else experience something similar or have some input?

On the server, generally speaking, ours sucks. I know we've got ourselves a pretty big guild and all, but we still need the rest of the wow community on Sargeras to get along with us. All we have is a big guild. We do not currently have a respectable guild. This is our fault. We need to improve.

I think we all need to go back to the CoC and take a long look at it, instead of just scrolling to the bottom and replying with a signature.

I'm not here with the beatstick or here to point fingers... but I am here to ask everyone in the guild to be more aware of the fact that other players have more negative things to say about &lt;reddit&gt; tagged members than they have positive things to say.

This is not a ""haters gonna hate"" situation. This is a situation where we've got too many extremely childish members out there doing extremely childish things in-game. Be nice to others who are outside the guild, be respectful of everyone. 

* Carry yourself as though you're proud of yourself and your guildmates... 

* Do well in dungeons and pvp. 

* Don't bot. ever.

* Stop naming your characters stupid shit like: 'Goodweed', 'CaptnNuggz' and 'Buttz' ... I, for one, will not invite characters that have names designed to be overtly annoying/stupid or sound like you were actually high when you named them. (if you really want screenshots from Goodweed explaining how fucking high he is, I can do that... but for now just let the point stand)

* Stop Trolling public channels (stop trolling guild chat and /reddit)

Let's say that as the sun came up on the rest of you this morning, I awoke to find that my house had been left behind and is now floating in space. How quickly would it get cold? How long would we have until the temp reached life-threatening conditions?

It's a pretty boring house, built in the 1970s, &gt;1500sq'. None of the appliances would work, including the heater, because I'd be in space and my utility company doesn't offer service there.

Let's assume my house is airtight and also has some sort of magic-powered CO2 filter contraption. Also, let's assume that any of the other nerdy stuff you are thinking of is also covered by the magic-powered contraption, but I accidentally bought the model that doesn't supply heat.

I had started the interview process back in August.  Went through four different interviews, and each time I went back, the job I was applying for was different.  It involved radio and digital and sales of some sort at the local midsized company.  After the fifth time meeting, I am offered a job they ""created""  involving purely digital.  I would have every sales manager, the digital specialists (for their upcoming push in digital), and the GM as a boss.  I would be the other guy following behind everyone making sure digital was being sold.  I was to have few limitations as everything was in the grey area.

I start on the third.  One of the sales managers emailed me Monday saying she had a position open up as a regular sales executive, the exact position I first applied for in July.  I would be paid more, have only her as my superior, and be limited to her three stations.  I would no longer have grey area and just be a regular sales exec.

My thoughts have been everywhere.  If I take her offer, I make more.  I need money.  A wedding this year and current living conditions make me want to say yes.  I also could really take hold of sales.  However, I like digital and see where it's going.  This company just started a mobile app, and somehow wants to take on Groupon.  I want to help with that.

I used to work for a large corporation with a huge membership database.  One day, one of the account reps got an error that said she did not have permissions to alter a table.  She showed the error on her screen to her supervisor.  Normally, when a function asked for this, there would be some quirk where a table had the wrong permissions, but before she entered her admin password, she felt something was odd: this employee wasn't doing anything that required a table change as all she changed were records.  So she left the error hanging, and contacted a DBA.

The DBA logged out, and logged in as the employee again, and when he tried to alter a record, he got the same error.  In addition, another account rep was reporting the same error.  So the DBA looked at his error logs, and long story short, shut down the system.

Turns out a former DBA who had been let go over half a year ago had sneaked some lines of code into the client interface.  It was basically ""if DATE is past [yesterday's date], do a delete query on *."" If ANYONE had entered in an admin password to override this error, they would have deleted millions of customer records.  Sure, they had tape backups, but it would have been wiped out again the second someone found the same thing and entered in the password.

The client code was changed, and pushed out to the account reps immediately.  The manager who hesitated entering in her password because ""something wasn't right"" got a bonus.

This left me in the terrible position of having to find a new place and move within about 30 days, in one of the busiest times of the year. I was thankfully able to find a suitable place within a week. It's very comparable to the old one, but there is one thing the new place is lacking that I will miss every day: a basement. I was able to turn the basement into a wonderful practice space (I'm a drummer). The setup muffled the sound outside the basement to the point that a full band could barely be heard from outside - we've had a band playing down there until 5 in the morning before, and not once did we bother the neighbors.

This was four months ago, but I posted and asked for photoshops of my friend jumping off a cliff. If you don't remember, he was the fat guy (see above).

The response was so overwhelming and so many quality shops were coming in that I waited until the day of his party to print the photos so I didn't miss an amazing 11th hour entry. I ended up picking my favorite 50 and printing them off as 4x6 photos at Walmart from a kiosk. Some cropping was necessary, but they turned out well. The photo section guy wouldn't come back from lunch early to ring me up, so I ended up being slightly late to the party and ditching the album and just gave him the photos. He loved them:

I took so long to post this because I thought I lost the two pictures above due to some SD card related phone shenanigans. They mysteriously reappeared recently and I saw them when I checked my gallery today for something else. I actually had about 10, most of which were better than these, but you can at least see the joy/embarrassment on his face.

I saved all of the shops and made a facebook album and tagged him in every single one, so all of his friends were able to see your handywork even if you didn't make it into the top 50 printed photos. There ended up being over 220.

My all time favorite was the Precious movie poster, but there were tons of amazing, funny, clever and awesome shops.

We will have some movies on in the background (Blade Runner, Sin City, other suggestions are welcome).

* Get out more! (done and done)
* Go to a bar pick up a random girl and get your confidence back! (bars in the pacific northwest have almost nobody under 45 in them)
* Get a hobby, meet girls doing something you love! (took dance classes, and joined a gym)
* Go take a class at the junior college and meet a girl there! (classes were 80% male 18% female and 2% some weird semi-solid human shaped blob I could not identify) 
* Try some volunteer work, there are lots of girls there! (look at all these happy couples!) 
* Network, ask friends to hook you up with girls! (amazingly of the 40 to 50 people I regularly interact with nobody knows any single girls even close to my age, or they just don't really try that hard to ask around after I bring it up)
* Try online dating! (total disaster)
* Ignore women, don't think about them and it will just happen! (the smell of desperation is far more powerful than feigned disinterest, and women are like sharks, they can detect a single drop in a vast ocean) 
* Go get a hooker! (I'll pass...)
* Try a church! (from the same guy who first suggested a hooker ironically enough) 
* Get rich, women love money! (from a guy who has a steady girlfriend who pays all his bills...)
* Change how you look/act! (good idea, lets do this!)
* Change how you look/act! (after following the above item the first time)
* Just be yourself! (y u no tell me before?? i spend all  of money on new clothes!!!??) 

*le sigh*

I've tried *everything* on that list several times over except for getting a hooker, not for any moral reasons but simply because with my terrible luck I'm sure I would catch something permanent and then I'd ***REALLY*** have a hard time with the added complication of a nasty STD.

edit: and technically I guess I have not tried the ""getting rich"" one, but I do okay for myself, and some of my friends without jobs right now still manage to swim in a sea of vagina every night... 

Any other ideas? Obviously *I'm doing it wrong.*

**TLDR: 2010 sucked, anyone else feeling the same pain?**

edit2: I suspect part of the problem is the era my generation grew up in. Nobody in my high school was getting laid regularly, hundreds of kids, all scared shitless of sex due to years and years of being told how horrible all the consequences were without having any access to actual useful information. Brace yourselves kids, the internet did not exist at this time, no wikipedia, no websites designed to help kids with questions about puberty and sexuality in an open format. All we had was scrambled porn on channel 98 and 99 and an old JC penny summer catalog. A few lucky kids had a dad with a dusty playboy from 1973.

From midnight last night (as they do every time there's a big event on) the 1/4 hour, 1 hour, 2 hour etc parking along Grey Street get their signs turned around and become BCC Bus Zone / Towaway Zones.

Now I might be a simple lad, but how hard would it be for BCC to turn off these parking meters?  They're the new electronic style ones (you enter your rego, swipe your credit card etc, not the old coin/flip the meter style) so surely somebody in BCC HQ could turn them off remotely.

Celexa was an excellent part of my recovery that helped fix the pattern of up/down, manic/depression I had created through a dysfunctional childhood and drug filled adulthood.  It helped retrain my brain to live in the shallower regions of emotional extremes so I could start to untangle myself from the mis-learning and lack of learning so common in ALL types of dysfunctional upbringings (alcohol, drugs, workaholics, sex addicts, etc .)

Well, I was lucky and along with Celexa I had a well-versed in new therapies analyst that helped me not only work on the chemicals insides but the mental, physical and sociological issues that all must be addressed in an aggressive recovery.    Celexa held the damn from bursting while I was given the space to explore who I was, what was missing and what was needed to thrive.

Now 8 years later I have come so far I can't even believe it sometimes.  I often get mired in day to day drama and forget how much progress I've made in my personality, my depression, my sadness, my dread, my life, my confidence and especially my relationship to my inner child.

And all of that possible with the help from a tiny little pill that held my serotonin in when I just wanted to dump it out all at once.  

Withdrawal is hard, it's been 3 weeks after tapering off over a month long period and the side effects are daunting - twitches, zaps, neck/back pain, dizziness, vertigo and many others but also a profound reawakening of my sadness and my relationship to my emotions.  I had forgotten how lovely poetry can be and how much I could feel and express but also what it feels like to do  a lot of crying and some downright sobbing.

But my work over the last 8 years is holding and while extremely sad right now I am compensating with my newfound areas of recovery (exercise, diet, socialization, meditation, sleep and fun) and making sure I keep things in proper perspective.  I know that I will be fine.  My little guy inside knows I will be fine and together we are coping and actually enjoying this emotional reawakening.

Good bye buddy.

Now, normally I'm a very shy guy, so I don't know if it was the extra man juice from lifting heavy things for an hour or what, but for whatever reason I made kickass eye contact with the cute cashier.  Which she maintained.

I tried it again at Jamba Juice today, and got the same result.  Not only that, but she actually partook in what I would have to call flirting.  So I guess I have two questions:

1) Is maintaining eye contact considered flirting?  Even though she didn't really say anything, just from her look I felt like that first girl was kind of into me.  Or is eye contact just what normal people do?

2) Is maintaining eye contact with another guy acceptable?  To me, eye contact seems kind of intimate, but again, that might just be because I'm not used to it.",-1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I've been playing around with creating my own no-knead bread recipes ('cause no-knead is so cool!) and this one turned out so well, I thought I'd share it. Whole Wheat + Garam Masala + Blue Cheese.

The garam masala makes for really savory bread. Anyway, enjoy!

3 1/2 cups whole wheat 
1/2 cup gluten 
2 teaspoons machine yeast
2 tablespoons garam masala powder
A pinch of salt

Do not knead! Stir the ingredients together only, and treat it gently. Mix it all together and let it sit for 18-24 hours in a covered bowl. It should be a little bubbly on the top (no-knead bread takes a little longer with whole-wheat). If you don't have gluten, I'd recommend a 50/50 whole wheat/white flour combo. Same 2/1 flour/water ratio.

Lay into a deep cast iron pot filled with parchment paper. Sprinkle with Danish blue cheese and rosemary. Gently pat the blue cheese and rosemary into the dough... enough so that it will be incorporated into the crust, rather than burning off on top. Let rise for 2-4 hours.

Everyday I watch couples, I see husbands and wives..and I'm jealous.  I'm jealous of women who aren't hated by their husbands.  I'm jealous of women who are wanted by their husbands.  I'm jealous of women who haven't been told they aren't needed or wanted.  I'm jealous of women who can smile.  I'm jealous of anyone whom can smile.  I want a life not smothered in this.  I want to feel how I felt before I was told he was indifferent to me.  I want to feel how I felt before he lied and cheated on me.  I want to feel how I felt before he left me, before he betrayed me, before he broke every promise, before he left me behind, before he took me for granted, before he used me, before he fucked other girls behind my back, before he left me those sleepless nights and never came home, before he lied to me, before he treated me so badly. Everyone knew before me that he was leaving. I want to feel how I felt before he told me he ""would be okay if i wasn't around"".    I don't understand why he treats everyone better than me.  I don't understand why he treats even strangers better than me.  I just don't understand.

I can't remember a time that I have felt this badly.  I can't remember a time that I have felt so unloved and hated.  I just don't understand.  Why? I don't understand what I did wrong.  I tried as hard as I could. I still failed.  I doubt at times if he ever loved me.  I doubt at times of what his intentions really were.  I just don't understand.

Why is it other men want me more than my husband?  Why is it other men constantly ask to see me, be around me, but not my husband?  Why do I remain loyal to my husband after he cheated, after he lied, after he hurt me and after he broke every promise and vow?

Why am I alone again? Why am I going to bed and waking up alone? Why am I doing this...again? I don't deserve this.  I don't deserve to be lied to, I don't deserve to be betrayed, I don't deserve to be cheated on, I don't deserve to be treated like I don't exist.  I don't deserve to cry myself to sleep at night.  I don't deserve to wake up and wish I hadn't. I don't deserve to believe my husband would rather I be dead. 

No matter if I talked to him, he'd get mad at me.  He'd turn it on me, he'd blame it on me, he'd make ME feel bad.  I can't win and I never will.  If I try talking to him, he'll throw it back in my face and threaten to end things.  He'll tell me he ""doesn't want to deal with it and he's tired of it"".

281862,"""The Argument from psychopathy""

It is impossible to cohere the existence of psychopaths with a theistic world-view.
A psychopath is someone without a conscience. The structure of their brain renders them incapable of experiencing empathy. As such, they are simply ""born evil"", without hope of being ""fixed"", because there is no cure.
Some people try to rationalize the contradiction between their world-view and the existence of psychopaths by positing that psychopathy has a largely environmental cause. But research repeatedly shows that psychopaths are born and not caused. Twin studies show that psychopathy has a strong genetic component. This is largely due to the nuerobiological structure of the patient’s brain, and is present from birth. A person with the best family in the world can still be a psychopath.
(http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/health/Psychopaths-are-born-bad-say.2629408.jp)

So the question must be asked; why would God allow for some people to be born without a conscience? If life is a test to see who will get into heaven, surely everyone must possess a conscience (an understanding of the difference between “right” and “wrong”).

X implies Y, Y implies X, or some as-yet-unknown Z implies both X and Y.  This should apply to the Euthyphro argument.  And therefore the question:

Is it possible that some other property could cause an action to be both moral and commanded by God?

284095,"Heres where I am supposed to introduce myself and give a brief about the story I am about to tell.

My insurance is due on the 15th of every month. I have had my insurance since September, this year. This month however, I was late. And not pregnant late, I was insurance late which turns out to be just as surprising. 
I moved to a new house on the 13th of this month and have been making preparations at my old place to hold true to my lease. You see, my landlord was a wacknut and I came across an opportunity I couldnt pass, so we moved quickly.
I could give a hundred excuses but for whatever reason I missed my payment. Infact, I forgot all the way until today, when I saw their commercial on TV. So at about 5:30pm today, I paid my insurance company. He insured (oh the laughter) me that I was all paid up and everything was sound. 
Great I thought, since I just washed all my laundry and needed to go dry it (dryer broke, I am not made of money... sad). So, my girlfriend, who I have lived with for over 2 years, and my best friend who is our roommate who we lived with for 4 months, came with to dry their clothes too! My girlfriend drove, I drove shotgun and my friend was in the backseat.
After we left, we saw a lot of cop lights up a street that was on our way to laundromat. Of course we drove by to check it out - this is where the problems start.
I saw a cop car leave the scene after they were a block behind us. He quickly flashed his lights and drove really fast through an intersection (4 way stop sign, mind you this is a small town / wannabe city) to get up behind us. He continued to be on our ass the whole way across the bridge to the other town where we moved from (1 mile).

He pulled us over just as we got to the other side. When he approached the car, he seemed upset for some reason and requested all of our IDs. He also confirmed my name and then asked if I got any mail recently, I told him no. He said well your registration is suspended, did you have any insurance that lapsed? I told no, in fact I just paid it not 10 minutes ago. He left and went to his squad car.

At this time we are trying to figure out exactly what the issue could be as the representative told me my insurance was reinstated. We discussed being late and I even told a cheesy story about what happened to cause me to be late. He went on to say the account is ok and that my next pay date was the 15th.

The cop comes back and tells me, ""I just got off the phone with a supervisor with your insurance and they told me they havent talked to you and your insurance has been out for 3 weeks. They said you did not make a payment and are pretty upset with you that the vehicle is registered to you and she has the insurance.""

I was baffled and started telling the cop that I just paid it not 15 minutes ago. The car is registered to me, but the person who drives it, has it insured. I am not a driver, so I am not listed. It even asks on the site that I signed up for it on who the vehicle is registered to, me. So the insurance is well aware.

He continued to tell me that he has to take the plate as PennDOT (PA drivers thing).  According to the [DMV of PA website](http://www.dmv.state.pa.us/pdotforms/fact_sheets/fs-inla.pdf), Your lapse must be more than 31 days to have your plate taken/surrendered. I was unsure of this at the time so I didnt say anything about it.

At this point I got out of the vehicle, hit redial and called the insurance co. I had a rep on the phone who could confirm everything and the officer wanted nothing to do with it. He went to his vehicle and the tow guy was off to work, on my car. Insane.

After talking with the tow guy, I convinced him to just tow to my house (1 mile away.....) instead of losing my car over the next 3 days (they are closed, holiday then sunday). Cost? $125.

The cop then comes out of his car and tried to justify what he was doing telling me people try to rip off insurance by insuring it and letting someone else drive, but I again told him... Only the insured is driving this vehicle. :/ He said that if we can get him proof of having insurance at that time, he can take of the potential $1000 fines (WTF?!).

As you know, I did follow up with the insurance company after I got my car home. The supervisor rep I requested to speak to, told me that my insurance is infact reinstated right after payment is received and she has no record of a supervisor talking to an officer, as the supervisors have to take notes when they speak to a cop. Hoping that the super was lazy, she was attempting to the find the rep that the cop spoke with. I demanded to speak with the supervisors supervisor (wtf?) but was unable to reach them tonight. 
The nice lady I talked to said she is going to send a fax to the cop letting him know when my insurance was reinstated. 
So at this point, I probably wont hear from the insurance until the morning... 

TL;DR - Got pulled over, cops call insurance, insurance lies and says i did not have insurance when i did. I call insurance and they state I do have insurance but cop doesnt wanna hear it, tows car anyway.

SO, who is responsible here? 

Me - Perhaps I should have not let my insurance lapse and predict the future instead of receiving proper phone calls / letters stating status changes

Cop - The law states 31 days, I was within the limit and he should not have taken my plate. He towed the car on the basis that the plate is no longer on the car, if he didnt take illegally take my plate, perhaps this wouldnt have been so...

Insurance - Why did they lie? :O


EDIT - already paid the $125..

EDIT2 - Just got off the phone with insurance. She could not believe the dodgy work of her reps! Her name was Janice (look at me getting names now) and she said she is talking to her Manager about the towing bill. She brought it up, not me. :D

Two nights ago I stayed in a Hampton Inn in an Inland Empire city (Southern California's wine country hint hint) where a couple of high school basketball teams were staying (fuck you if that was you). Around 11pm my girlfriend and I were laying in bed when all of a sudden the antics next door skyrocketed. At one point I thought we might have been staying next door to a stampeding herd of wild broncos and or a family of chimpanzees with the amount of racket that was going on. I decided to give these presumed animals a couple more chances to shut the fuck up before I raised some hell by politely calling the front desk. I called the desk and said ""Hey I'm in room 101 and"" and he said ""Yeah I am outside right now...there is not much I can do about them."" He offered to put me on the 3rd floor but I politely declined as our stuff was spread throughout the room already. I said ""You need to do something about this...this is a hotel, not a daycare center."" He agreed and we went to sleep later. 

Remembering a sign that was glued to the front desk that said ""If you're not happy, you don't pay"" and thinking ""yeah I wonder how often that shit happens"" I had the magnificent idea of trying to save at least little bit of money on the hotel room by letting the front desk girl know that our stay was subpar upon check-out.

So, easy as pie except for all of my emotions ripping me to shreds and the sadness choking me.  *Sigh*

We've grown apart and have been wanting different things from each other and out of our relationship.  He asked me 6 months ago for a divorce, then took it back the next day stating he may have spoken too soon, and I took him back.  Since then, we've been going through spurts of great, and fits of worse.  We've been trying to have more discussions and communicate, but it's been fairly obvious that we're not the same people we were when we started out together.  

Our biggest differences:  kids, rent vs own, amount/quality of time spent together, diet (near-primal vs likes the occasional grilled cheese w Kraft processed slices on thick whole-grain bread,  oooh and pasta, and dinner rolls...can you tell which one likes to indulge in carbs?), exercise (fun and unorganized vs regimented w goal-setting), acceptable time spent on WoW and other games, what to do with vacation, what to spend money on, spending time with family and friends, ease of communication (I currently work varied shifts so am not home at regular times, and he is very frequently decked out in a headset, talking with his guild, fighting in many raids and can't pause the game-WoW, I hate you for that-insert look of disapproval that I'm too lazy to find here).  

Blech, there are a lot of differences, but we did/do have a lot in common as well.

So, he's spending the night somewhere, and won't sleep here again.  He'll tell our friends tomorrow why we can't be at their New Years Eve party, and I'll tell my family/friends.  He'll look into the divorce papers (I cry A LOT, so would be pretty useless on a phone call).  We'll figure out what things need name changes for ownership's sake, and when/how moving his belongings out will go.

I hate that we have so many friends in common.  Most of our friends were his first, but we've gotten along so swimmingly that I also consider them mine.  How do you get around that?  I can't wrap my mind around it.

I'm also bummed that I've become a statistic of divorce.  My family is full of divorces, including my own parents, so I'm not unfamiliar with the good and bad that comes with separation, but I felt so strongly that we were meant for each other and it could never happen.

I'm torn between getting sucked into an abyss of despair or re-inventing myself and moving forward (I have an urge to paint and redecorate, or find a place closer to work and start fresh-but I have to keep in mind I'll be footing the rent very soon-though he's offered to help to make sure I'm ok).

Thanks for listening. :/  He's also a redditor, so I'll also need to consider leaving Reddit until I'm done hurting. 

TL/DR:  Divorced (well, soon-to-be).  Sad.  Worried.  Annoyed that there is no time machine to transport me to the future to show me that everything is going to be ok.  Thanks.

I'm a rails dev (well, actually I'll be managing the dev team when we actually have one) for a startup company which is in the final stages of getting funded. So far we've all been working for nothing and have been using komodo editor since it's good and it's free. Since we'll actually have a budget for these things soon, I've been thinking about what to use for myself and the people I need to hire. So far redmine is looking the best. I've also used aptana studio (radrails), eclipse with the radrails plugin (both were pigs).

Anybody have experience going through the process of testing out IDE's? Which ones did you like/dislike and why? What did you end up going with? We're looking to stick with windows, so no mac only stuff please.

---

**Edit:** Lots of people have addressed that I should be using linux or mac instead of windows. I addressed that in a couple comments, here's one.

I actually love linux and would actually prefer using it. My home PC is windows only because Mozy doesn't make a linux client. Honestly, that's it. I do admin a fairly large windows network for a living though. Linux fails badly in a highly automated IT environment. There is no suitable alternative for AD/eDir or Zen/SCCM (that I know of at least).

I have a ubuntu VM with seamless mode ready and willing. I even have ubuntu wubi'd as an alternative startup OS. I find myself not using them very often because there isn't anything for what I'm doing that I can't do on windows.

With that said, I'd be a crazy man if my development and production servers weren't running linux. There's no question there.

One song by each band, both tracks were mastered by Jeff Reeves at Masterdisk NYC. Artwork and screenprinting handled by Three Bears Design's Charlie Wagers and all hand-numbered (red: #401-500, green: #201-400, blue: #1-200). Sooo, as you can see there are three different colors to choose from, as well as a package deal for all three colors. Each vinyl color's jacket corresponds with that color of vinyl (red vinyl = red jacket, etc.) We'll have 100 copies of ""Wild Cherry"" (translucent red), 200 copies of ""Blu-Rasberry"" (translucent blue), and 200 copies of ""Limeade"" (yup, translucent green). Each copy has a hand screenprinted cover with glow in the dark ink! These are printed on thick stock French Paper with the vinyl inserted into a thick black paper inner sleeve. Stick all that into a sturdy polybag and you've got a little bundle of beauty =) Yup, no jivin'. Get you some or become an eBay hater later""""

Throwaway account, obviously. This individual has been posting slanderous statements on twitter about various students under several usernames. Some of this content includes spreading rumors about STDs, homosexuality, among other things.

When the account gets reported for abused and banned, a new one pops up in its place. I'm not sure how, but the new account gets disseminated, and the slandering continues.

The school has been very uncooperative in resolving this. They would appear unwilling to go forth with the time effort and legal perseverance to seek out the individual who is responsible for this.

Many of my friends are upset by this. Several of them have been accused of having sexually transmitted diseases, and some others have been ""forced out of the closet."" To a high-schooler, these can be catastrophic to one's confidence.

What can be done to deal with this?

Edit: just to clarify, I'm not a student at this school, but several of my friends are. They've been asking me to ""investigate"" this and find out who it is, but I'm choosing the more morally objective route.

**UPDATE**: So it would seem this problem is more rampant than originally anticipated. Somebody started out with this idea, and now it's grown like a wildfire in my city, with many copycats now doing this, at least one in every high school. Would going to the media about this incite even MORE interest in this? Something must be done!

The story is possibly (probably) part of a larger series or trilogy. I believe the author's first or last name started with 'M' but that could be totally wrong. The book was probably written late eighties/early nineties and the version I read was paperback. I think there were several storylines going on at once, one in a city-environment and one in the jungle, but that might not be right either.

What I definitely remember: there was a tribe of jungle-dwelling humans who would throw out teenagers/kids of their society for certain reasons. I don't remember the reasons. The leader of a small pack of these cast-off kids is female and her ""second-mate"" is male. I can't remember which one, but either he or she had several of their fingers missing due to interaction with one of the jungle's many poisonous/deadly plants. Most of these kids die but a few survive.

Aaaand, that's it. I've pretty much given up hope on finding this story again, but I figure I'd give it a shot. Thanks for helping!

Also: these might not be from that story but they seem to lump together with it in my head: something about the people in the city are looking for a cure or something and there's some overlying plot going on involving some kind of weather-witchery things and towers.

Having a mob a few blocks below gives you a perfect opportunity to use that useless gravel to suffocate them as long as they are (obviously) within an arms reach. My girlfriend and I had this epiphany when there was a skeleton below her that couldn't be reached with a sword and was too risky to attempt with a bow as the skeleton would easily be able to knock her down off her perch.

285982,"First off I'll start by saying that I'm probably your typical 23-year-old ""geeky"" guy (tall and fairly thin and interest in technology etc.) with average looks and the only thing I've had that resembles a relationship was a 3-week fling with a girl 6 months ago and I've only ever asked someone out once - and got rejected. I should probably also add that I've never had sex. From that perspective it sounds like I shouldn't really be giving advice but I've learnt a lot in the past few months, got a job, dragged myself out of depression and generally been more sociable.

The reason I've decided to post here is because I was talking to my sister at a family gathering and at one point I asked her about this guy that was interested her who had apparently asked her out and although she turned him down (the reason she cited was because he was ""spineless and could walk all over him""), he keeps on doing favours for her under the pretense of friendship (e.g. she got an expensive christmas present off him, going way out of his way - driving about an hour or so from another city, just to take her home etc.) and she basically uses this to her advantage. Even though she's made it clear that she's not interested, I still think she's a bit of an asshole for doing this and a lot of it reminds me of what I used to be like when I was fairly desperate for a relationship - being single for so long meant that I had very low self esteem, I was very inexperienced with relationships and consequently I turned into what you would deem a typical ""nice guy"".

The point I'm trying to make is that if you like someone, don't constantly go out of your way to cater to their every whim or rush to their defence all the time, I'm not saying ""don't be nice"" or ""don't do any favours"", just don't do way more than you'd do for your other friends. **Nobody wants to go out with someone that they can walkover and make them do everything shy of jumping off a cliff.** That's something more akin to a slave than an actual relationship.

Second thing I want to say is **don't constantly live just for the moments that you hang out with the girl you like**, go out and socialise with other people too, hobbies etc. - i.e. don't make your life revolve completely around them and don't put your life on hold just for them.

Thirdly, don't change who you are and don't just like a particular band/hobby *just* because the person you like is interested in it. Basically you should just be yourself and not try to turn into a male version of the person you like.

Fourthly, **don't constantly over-analyse things and dwell on conversations** (e.g. She said X, does that mean she likes me?), just talk to people and have a laugh, if you like someone then ask them out (I should probably take my own advice on this one =/)

The other concept I'd like to mention is the ""friend zone"", in my opinion, a girl is either interested or she isn't, there's no mythical zone you get relegated to from not making a move for too long, I get the feeling that this myth is perpetuated by the typical ""nice guy"". **If the girl you like turns you down, just move on and find someone else, don't constantly smother her with gifts/favours hoping she'll change her mind.**

Since starting to sort my life out, I've had 2 girls ask me out (which I turned down), so you should really stop worrying so much about having a relationship, go out and have fun and don't have too many expectations. Also if there's something you don't like about yourself (e.g. you think you're too fat) then do something about it and don't wallow in self-pity.

The last thing I'll do is share the story of the second girl that had an interest in me. Me and this girl had known each other for a couple of months or so and I had been meeting up with her and a few other friends once a week for this time. I received an e-mail from her saying that she really likes castles, wanted to see some of them and asked if I wanted to ""tag along"" (what she really meant was ""be a taxi driver"" :P). It seemed like a laugh and I was free so I accepted the invitation. Since it was just me and her going, most of my friends decided that it was basically a date but I decided not to make any assumptions and focused on enjoying myself. On the day, I ended up driving her round to various castles, had a laugh, took a load of pictures and she insisted on buying me a meal after. During one of the conversations she was talking about this guy she was seeing, so if I had assumed that it was a date, it probably would've lead to the whole day being disappointing and slightly dragged out, I later learned that she'd also asked someone else to come along but he declined.
Fast forward to a couple of weeks later and her friends decided to drag me on a night out - it ended up being me and 3 girls xD. For some reason they decided to drag me into the room while they were all changing, which I was slightly confused by but I wasn't exactly going to complain :P. At one point during the night, she said that she was thinking of breaking up with the guy that she was seeing because they ""didn't quite work together"". Slightly later on in the evening, she found out that he'd been seeing someone else at the same time as her, cue a phonecall and a few choice words at him and her officially ending the relationship. She was a bit annoyed that he would do that but didn't seem too upset about it. Later on, she jokingly exclaimed that she'd been flirting with me all night and that I hadn't really paid attention to it (I'm pretty clueless, go figure xD) and then proceeded to ask me out. Unfortunately I didn't really have any feelings for her and turned her down because otherwise I'd just end up stringing her along, she understandably seemed disappointed but she's pretty confident and socialises with a lot of people, so she'll be fine. Sorry if you guys were expecting a happy ending :P.

Apologies for length :P.

Waited a few more minutes and took a sip. Alcohol burn kind of masking the flavors (still need to get past that small burn so I can taste more in depth). 

Added a bit of water. Can now smell the ""floral"" that everyone describes it as! Smells glorious.

Not only do they help motivate each other in seddit, it is the best way to learn. I apologize for the length of this FR, it is my first time writing one out but it is GOLD.



Intro: I am home visiting family over Christmas. I recently got out of a long relationship, and reading the posts on seddit had my mind on one thing: Pick up.



The very first night in town I met up with several friends that knew of a house party. House parties aren't really my thing and I was feeling pretty traveling lagged but I wasn't going to let that stop me from seeing what the night might have in store for me. Drove to the house party and met up with the few (maybe three) people that I knew going who met me outside to help show me in.  Following them around to the backyard, I realized I recognized several people that I met a few times prior that socializes with guys that invited me. Among that group was a really attractive HB8 and her friend, an HB7. I wasn't sure if the mutual friends would recognize me or not but decided ""fuck it,"" I would strike up a stellar conversation with them with a big entrance and see where it would land me with the HB8 and her friend.  My friends that led me in went to introduce me to their friends and before they could finish I went it for a BIG impact introduction. I decided that If I recognized them, they had to have recognized me and there was no point in pretending other wise. 


I went in swinging like I was hitting for the bleachers and greeted the first mutual friend I saw with a huge smile and man - hug like he was a long lost friend separated at birth and we where just now being reunited. It went so well that even before I finished his best friend next to him was already lining up to receive his acknowledgment and the HB8 and her friend where following suit. It was literally like he was waiting to hump my leg and in doing so she was completely focused on me like you wouldn't believe.  I gave the same warm welcoming to him like giving a bone to a patient dog that has been waiting outside, while I watched the HB8 whisper directly into my friends ear with a slight confused look without ever breaking direct eye contact with me grinning from ear to ear.  I moved on to her when I was done with her and gave her the look that you would give a 9 year old niece at a Christmas party who's name you forgot. I transitioned right over to her with a big patronizing ""OHHHHHHH I'm Sorrry, what's your name again???  :)"" and even though it was clear we had never met, she fell right into it almost thanking me for making it so easy for ME to let her introduce HERSELF.  I could not believe it, she was completely eating out of the palms of my hands just because I had made a big introduction and threw her a bone.    


For the rest of the night it was like the momentum just continued to build up by my entrance. Both her (the HB8) and her friend the HB7 looked at me stare - eyed when ever I talked to either of the guys in talking in the group, it was SO easy to engage them after that. They were pretty much making themselves available to me to engage at any time by ignoring everyone else.  Big introductions DO work!  


The party was starting to wind down and the HB8 said she was tired of staying up so late so I suggested that we sat off the the side of the party and people watch.  She was clearly giving me enough IOI's that I wanted to see how she would react to me separating the two of us from her friend and mine. She JUMPED on the offer as soon as I said it ""Me too I feel so jet lagged, let's take a seat on that rock and people watch from a distance.""


Eventually, her HB7 friend wanted to leave and came looking for her.  I number closed by letting her know that I was only going to be in town for a week and suggesting that hang out and have a good time before we leave while at the same time handing her my phone. The whole time she was smiling with stars in her eyes like when I first opened the group and dialed her number from my phone. We exchanged good byes and she took her friend home.

For the rest of the week I was fucking sick and did not leave bed. I was so frustrated because of how well that night went that here I was not doing a single thing with the fruit of my actions.  We texted here and there for the next couple of days ( I made it a point not to engage in ANY small talk. I let her know the day I was leaving and said I would reserve at least the last night for her, which she seemed to really like).Tonight was my last night and I texted her early, around 5pm with ""getting into anything fun tonight?.""  Turns out she was being dragged along to a strip club for her first time because of a friends birthday. I JUMPED at the opportunity and she suggested I tag along.  

Fast forward to the strip club. If you ever, EVER end up going to a strip club with a girl, for jesus FUCK use it to your advantage! you would not BELIEVE how horny you can get them if you play your cards right. The following advice I am not suggesting to take a girl to a strip club as a date. All I am saying is if you end up at one, with a girl, this is what you do. DO NOT be creepy and oogle the naked strippers and ignore the girls you brought like it is your first time seeing a pair of tits. Engage the strippers to interact with your lady friends and they will get into the erotic vibe of the place. For starters, for every stripper (and I mean everyone) that came up to me asking if I ""wanted a dance,"" I would smile, put my hand around the HB8 and say ""actually, this is her FIRST. Time. Here. And, she said that YOU are her FAVORITE girl HERE!."" They swarmed all OVER the hb8 like bee's to honey! it was AWESOME.  After doing that for a while, I led the HB8 by the hand to sit down with me in front of the stage. There was only one seat left (Oh bummer LOL) and had her share it with me. I took out a dollar out of my pocket and said something a long the lines of ""have you ever fed ducks at the pond with a loaf of bread?""   - ""um, yea?""  - ""Well here is your bread!"" I took out a dollar bill out of my pocket, folded it into half and set it on top of her head at the precise moment when one of the strippers that I got the HB8 to admit was attractive came by.  The stripper looked at the HB8's huge smile and look of shock, with a folded dollar bill just perfectly placed on top of her head and swooped down and motor boated the hb8 while taking the bill with her boobs. It. Was. Awesome.  It's her first time at a strip club, EVER, and I've got one of the hottest strippers in the place motor boating her while she is sitting on my lap.

For the rest of the night at the strip club (we didn't stay long), I played the ""OMG IT's her FIRST TIME HERE!"" Lean in and whisper ""*AND* it's her birthday!"" and give the girls a sly wink. The rest of the time there I compared bodies of the strippers with the HB8 until she started saying things like ""i think I could do that"" to ""I could definitely do that - sly look in the eyes"" me: ""why don't you get on stage then *Big Grin*"" her: ""Welllll... I don't know I don't want to make her look back."" Me: ""Ok, I GUESS (and I made a huge theatrical big deal) I'll just HAVE to take your word for it. For the time being. But until you show me she gets all the attention!""

After the strip club we rolled to a bar near by (my idea), and the HB8 just stared at me the entire time as if she could not believe the sequence of events that had just taken place. She looked like she had just been steam rolled.  This entire time her HB7 friend competed for both of my attention and hers - but we ignored her - so she fought for the attention of the AFC's (the mutual friends) that were gaga-ing over the strippers.  Worked out perfect for me.  The night was getting later and she hinted at wanted to go home, but insisted that I come along. It was obvious the level of attraction that had been built on throughout the night was at a climax. We left her friend with the AFC's and she drove straight to her place (she even offered to drive). HUGE IOI's here. We got there and she got REALLY shy, but kept hinting at me coming in.

If you are ever, EVER alone with a girl out side of her place and she hints in any WAY shape OR FORM to come it, take it and fucking run with it. It is a HUGE IOI. It is her thinking ""I reallllly want him to come in, but I want to give him any excuse to bail incase he is not that into me so I don't look bad.""  I accepted her offer to go inside, locked the door behind me and just straight. up. CAVE MANED."" I said something really pointless about her couch (does not matter AT ALL when you get to that point) and grabbed a full hand full of her hair at the back of her head behind her ears and brought her right into me, VERY slowly.  We kissed very passionately in a true cave man fashion and F-closed right there on her floor, ending up in her bed. HUGE SUCCESS.

If I can say anything at all when you open a set, you want your introductions to be a HUGE impact crushing the earth because it builds SO MUCH social proof that it keeps everyone interested  for the rest of the night. If you steamroll the introduction you can ride the momentum for the rest of the night! BIG INTRODUCTIONS = ASTRONOMICAL SOCIAL PROOF. 

Note: any grammar and spelling mistakes are due to it being 6 in the morning and wanted to just share the excitement of the night with you. There was no proof reading in this post!

The problem is: Neither of us are good at planning party in our own home! Our group of friends is pretty open to whatever we'll come up with. I've covered some obvious things. Help me with some more ideas that will spice things up!

Here's where we're at so far:

We have a stocked beer/liquor selection including a lot of special mixers for some particular drinks that we/friends like as well as all the standard stuff.

We have a nice big living room with Rock Band 1, 2, &amp; 3 set up on a nice large TV with a good sound system behind it. We've got a nice synthesizer for the new piano part and a few of us are actually good at piano, so this should be funny to watch how well it doesn't translate (anyone remember watching their friend, the trained drummer, for the first time?)

We've got a dining room a ways away so the noise shouldn't be too bad. It has a giant table that is great for gaming and sits next to a pile of board games that ranges from Agricola to Arkham Horror to Clue to Power Grid to Settlers of Catan to ... well I have too many board games to really go down this list so let's just say that there are a lot of gaming options. I even got my hands on a copy of Dixit in time which looks like a more-than-reasonable 6-person party piece. We have a lot of traditional party games, too. Catch Phrase, Pictionary, etc. A subset of us is also enthusiastic about combining Euchre with a few beers, too, so there are cards (which we can combine with poker chips as well, should that fit the mood).

I was raised to think that when you are hanging out with someone it is really rude to sit there and text someone else especially if it is just the two of you hanging out because that leaves the other person just sitting there hanging.

For instance I was looking after a girl at a bush party and she got taken into the bushes by some deuches while she was drunk and raped. Looking back I wish I beat the crap out of them, when they were acting all creepy and trying to take her off into the bushes before they actually did.

I will never give my belongings to a mugger, if they want what I have they will have to take it from my cold dead hands, they are hoping that you will be apathetic and weak, so that you wont put up a fight and they can feel like the ""big man"". I have been attempted mugged many times, 2 guns pulled on me, etc. I will still fight for what's right not what's easiest.

Is my plan fruitless and misguided?

**Background:**

My father has been working on a loan modification the past few months with [Onxy Mortgage](http://www.onyxloans.com/). He has not been making his house payments per instruction during the course of the modification. About a month ago he was contacted by [Jose Arauza](http://www.realestatespace.com/California/92530/agent-profile/296806-Jose-Arauza) informing my father that he was the new owner of the property and would give him $1,000 to vacate the premises. My father immediately contacted Onyx Mortgage and was informed not to worry. They investigated the issue and told him that the bank/lender had no record of sale and that he was safe during the course of the modification proceedings. Fast forward to this week and the Riverside County Sheriff showed up to evict my father. I spent all day yesterday reclaiming whatever mementos that were acquired in the 26 years of my family being there.

I originally planned to return today to donate any remaining clothes and recycle many old/damaged computer components. After reading the following articles: [1](http://mikerooneylaw.com/avoidforeclosure.aspx) [2]( http://www.market-ticker.org/akcs-www?post=176114) [3](http://rawstory.com/news/2008/Rep_Foreclosed_owners_should_squat_in_0130.html), I want to lawyer up, squat, and demand that they produce the note.

The property has been re-keyed, so for me to enter the house would probably be breaking &amp; entering. Also, this is not necessarily my fight because I was never an owner, but I feel justified because now I am just as much an owner as my father who I feel is being defrauded.

**Update 1:** I am going to hold off on squatting until I learn more about the situation, since I think many of my father's actions fall into the category of [inaction](http://mikerooneylaw.com/avoidforeclosure.aspx). Although I feel he is being defrauded, I am not going to help the issue by getting arrested.

**Update 2:** If you are going to start missing house payments, please contact your lender directly. My father refuses to call his current lender. He just stopped paying and has never called them. They also have a database to find a loan agent. Government websites warn that no one doing loan modifications should be paid any money up front and he has currently paid a 3rd party more than $1000 so far and another $500 that he is 'late' on. They first promised the loan documents to be ready in December, but as it got closer and closer to Christmas, turned out the documents would not be ready until January.",-1,-1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-1,-1,-1,0,-1,-1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-1,-1,-1,0,-1,-1,0

289807,"Last night I went to Specs with my girlfriend to pick up something for new years. We wound up buying a bottle of Sake and some sparkling wine for the big day. Shortly after, we managed to score an eighth of some purple kush. 

We decided to play a drinking game: we were going to watch Team America World Police and every time we heard ""America"", we'd take a hit of the kush. Every time we heard ""derka"", we'd take a shot of sake. And every time we heard ""Matt Damon"", we'd take two swigs.

What followed was an unforgettable night of getting completely fucked up. I don't drink often, I always prefer smoking over alcohol, but trees, believe me when I say, we did it right last night.

The distribution of words we picked in the movie was perfect and presented a real challenge. By exactly the end of the movie we were down one bottle of sake and multiple bowls of kush.

In short, this experience is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! It was incredibly fun. I can't think of any other movie better suited for this.

TL;DR: Smoked and drank to TAWP and the rules we picked beforehand worked out great. If you try it, be prepared for a real kick in the ass, and no cheating!

290141,"I am an 18 year old high school student as the title states. To begin I want to tell you of the beginning of my life. I was born into a upper class family in Newport Beach, CA. My family is comprised of multiple successful people. As such, the expectations have been placed extremely high for myself, my parent's only child. 
 
In 2002, at the age of 10, I made my first independent investment, buying a middle size house in Costa Mesa, reselling it for a 220 % gain. This was the start of my investment career, until 2007 I traded stocks and accumulated a wealth of 7.2 million dollars. 

In 2007, at the age of 15, I started dating a girl I had been very close with for ~5 years. Later that year, her father, a widow, passed away. My family took her in and raised her, providing for her (not that she needed our money) and made sure she was loved. While this may seem awkward that we still dated, we still are and I plan on marrying her some day.

When I was a child I had 3 goals: 

*  Own a Ferrari. I accomplished this goal earlier this year when I bought a Ferrari Fiorano as a gift to self.

2. Find true love. This one is debateable to most, but the girl I have been with and love is my true soulmate. We have been though each other's hardest times together and we still love each other.

3. Tell my parents I'm not becoming a doctor. This may seem pathetic but this was my birthright. Or birthforce... Not sure what to call it. My family is exceptionally bright and I was no exception. I have maintained a 98% grade average at one of the best private schools in NA. I have determined I want to be a lawyer so that is why I am leaning towards going to Harvard next year.
